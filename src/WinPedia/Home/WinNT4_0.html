      Windows NT 4.0 is a preemptively multitasked, 32-bit operating system that
      is designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor
      <abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</abbr>. It was Microsoft's primary
      business-oriented operating system until the release of Windows 2000.
      Three editions were sold - Workstation, Server and Embedded editions, and
      each edition featured a Graphical User Interface UI similar to that of
      Windows 95. Windows NT 4.0 was the last public release of Microsoft
      Windows for the Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC architectures.

        Windows NT 4.0 received six service packs during its lifecycle, as well
        as numerous service rollup packages and option packs. Only the first
        service pack was made available for the MIPS architecture, Service Pack
        2 was the final release for the PowerPC architecture, and Service Pack 6
        was the final release for the Alpha architecture. Service Pack 6a (SP6a)
        is the last released service pack for Windows NT 4.0.
      </p>

      <p>
        Service Pack 7 was planned at one stage in early 2001, but this became
        the Post SP6a Security Rollup and not a full service pack, released on
        July 26, 2001, 16 months following the release of Windows 2000 and
        nearly three months prior to the release of Windows XP.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to bug fixes, the service packs also added a multitude of
        new features such as Ultra DMA mode for disk drives along with bus
        mastering, newer versions of Internet Information Services, user
        accounts and user profile improvements, smart card support, improved
        symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) scalability, clustering capabilities,
        MMX / 3DNow! / SSE / SSE2 support, AGP support, COM support
        improvements, Event Log service, MS-CHAPv2 and NTLMv2, SMB packet
        signing, Syskey, boot improvements, WINS improvements, Routing and
        Remote Access Service (RRAS), PPTP, DCOM/HTTP tunneling improvements,
        IGMPv2, WMI, Active Accessibility and NTFS 3.0 support among others.

      <p>
        Although the chief enhancement has been the addition of the Windows 95
        shell, there are several major performance, scalability and feature
        improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC.
        Windows NT 4.0 also introduced the concept of system policies and the
        System Policy Editor.
      </p>
      <p>Other important features were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crypto API</li>
        <li>
          Telephony API 2.0 with limited Unimodem support, which was the first
          release of TAPI on Windows NT
        </li>
        <li>DCOM and new OLE features</li>
        <li>Microsoft Transaction Server for network applications</li>
        <li>
          Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ), which improved interprocess
          communication
        </li>
        <li>Winsock 2 and the TCP/IP stack improvements</li>
        <li>File system defragmentation support</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The server editions of Windows NT 4.0 include Internet Information
        Services 2.0, Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, NetShow Services, Remote Access
        Service (which includes a PPTP server for VPN functionality) and
        Multi-Protocol Routing service. There are new administrative wizards and
        a lite version of the Network Monitor utility shipped with System
        Management Server. The Enterprise edition introduced Microsoft Cluster
        Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        One significant difference from previous versions of Windows NT is that
        the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into kernel mode rather
        than being in user mode in the CSRSS process. This eliminated a
        process-to-process context switch in calling GDI functions, resulting in
        a significant performance improvement over Windows NT 3.51, particularly
        in the graphical user interface. This, however, also mandated that
        graphics and printer drivers had to run in kernel mode as well,
        resulting in potential stability issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows NT 4.0 was the first release of Microsoft Windows to include
        DirectX as standard—version 2 shipped with the initial release of
        Windows NT 4.0, and version 3 was included with the release of Service
        Pack 3 in mid-1997. However advanced hardware accelerated Direct3D and
        DirectSound multimedia features were never available on Windows NT 4.0.
        Later versions of DirectX were not released for Windows NT 4.0. However,
        OpenGL was supported; it was used by Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.
      </p>
      <p>
        In early releases of 4.0, numerous stability issues did occur as
        graphics and printer vendors had to change their drivers to be
        compatible with the kernel mode interfaces exported by GDI. The change
        to move the GDI to run in the same process context as its caller was
        prompted by complaints from NT Workstation users about real-time
        graphics performance, but this change put a considerable onus on
        hardware manufacturers to update device drivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows NT 4.0 also included a new Windows Task Manager utility.
        Previous versions of Windows NT included the Task List utility, but it
        only shows applications currently on the desktop. To monitor CPU and
        memory usage, users were forced to use Performance Monitor. The task
        manager offers a more convenient way of getting a snapshot of all the
        processes running on the system at any given time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internet Explorer 2 was bundled with Windows NT 4. The installation of
        Internet Explorer 4 on Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later) gave
        Windows NT 4.0 Active Desktop and browser integration into Windows
        Explorer, known as the Windows Desktop Update.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows NT 4.0 upgraded NTVDM's x86 emulation in the RISC versions from
        286 to 486. Sysprep was introduced as a deployment tool with Windows NT
        4.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        x86 versions of Windows NT 4.0 require the BIOS firmware. RISC versions
        of Windows NT 4.0 require the ARC firmware.

            >Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition</span
          >, released in 1997, is the precursor to the Enterprise line of the
          Windows server family (Advanced Server in Windows 2000). Enterprise
          Server was designed for high-demand, high-traffic networks. Windows NT
          4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition includes Service Pack 3. The Enterprise
          Edition saw the introduction of the /3GB boot flag, which changed the
          default virtual address space mapping from 2 GB kernel and 2 GB user
          space to 1 GB kernel and 3 GB userland. This version also sees the
          first introduction of cluster service.

          >, (known as Windows-based Terminal Server 4.0 and Windows Terminal
          Server 4.0 in beta builds) released on June 16, 1998, allows the users
          to log on remotely. The same functionality was called Terminal
          Services in Windows 2000 and later server releases, and also powers
          the Remote Desktop feature that first appeared in Windows XP and later
          versions of Windows. Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, like
          Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition, includes Service Pack 3.

          <span style="font-weight: 600">Windows NT 4.0 Embedded</span>
          (abbreviated NTe) is an edition of Windows NT 4.0 that was aimed at
          computer-powered major appliances, vending machines, ATMs and other
          devices that cannot be considered general-purpose computers per se. It
          is the same system as the standard Windows NT 4.0, but it comes
          packaged in a database of components and dependencies, from which a
          developer can choose individual components to build customized setup
          CDs and hard disk boot images. Windows NT 4.0 Embedded includes
          Service Pack 5. It was succeeded by Windows XP Embedded. Microsoft
          ended mainstream support for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded on June 30, 2003,
          and received three years of extended support, which means that support
          for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded ended on the same day support for Windows
          98 and Windows Me ended on July 11, 2006.

      <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
      <p>
        Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 was the first version of the NT family to
        feature a GUI similar to that of Windows 95. Windows NT 4.0 introduced
        the user interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT family, including the
        Windows shell, File Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer at the time),
        and the use of "My" nomenclature for shell folders (e.g. My Computer).
        It also includes most components introduced with Windows 95. Internally,
        Windows NT 4.0 was known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). While many
        administrative tools, notably User Manager for Domains, Server Manager
        and Domain Name Service Manager still used the old graphical user
        interfaces, the Start menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user
        shortcuts and folders from the shared shortcuts and folders by a
        separator line. One significant difference from previous versions of
        Windows NT is that the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into
        kernel mode rather than being in user mode in the
        <abbr title="Client Server Runtime SubSystem">CSRSS process</abbr>. This
        eliminated a process-to-process context switch in calling GDI function,
        which results in a significant performance improvement over Windows NT
        3.51, particularly in the graphical user interface. This, however, also
        mandated that graphics and printer drivers had to run in kernel mode as
        well, resulting in potential stability issues.
