          Windows 10X was an edition of Windows 10, a major release of the
          Microsoft Windows series of operating systems. Announced by Microsoft
          on October 2, 2019, it was initially developed as an operating system
          to support dual-screen devices, such as the unreleased Surface Neo.
          10X was expected to be released in 2020, but Microsoft later announced
          that the project had been cancelled in May 2021. However, some
          features and design changes from 10X were integrated into the newer
          Windows 11. While the operating system was originally designed for
          dual-screen devices, Windows 10X shifted its target to single-screen
          devices in 2020 due to increasing demand for traditional computers
          from the COVID-19 pandemic.

          Windows CE, later known as Windows Embedded CE and Windows Embedded
          Compact, is a discontinued operating system developed by Microsoft for
          mobile and embedded devices. It was part of the Windows Embedded
          family and served as the software foundation of several products
          including the Handheld PC, Pocket PC, Auto PC, Windows Mobile, Windows
          Phone 7 and others.

          Unlike Windows Embedded Standard, Windows For Embedded Systems,
          Windows Embedded Industry and Windows IoT, which are based on Windows
          NT, Windows CE uses a different hybrid kernel. Microsoft licensed it
          to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who could modify and
          create their own user interfaces and experiences, with Windows
          Embedded Compact providing the technical foundation to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Earlier versions of Windows CE worked on MIPS and SHx architectures,
          but in version 7.0 released in 2011—when the product was also renamed
          to Embedded Compact—support for these were dropped but remained for
          MIPS II architecture. The final version, Windows Embedded Compact 2013
          (version 8.0), released in 2013, only supports x86 and ARM processors
          with board support package (BSP) directly. It had mainstream support
          until October 9, 2018, and extended support ended on October 10, 2023;
          however, license sales for OEMs will continue until 2028.

          server-oriented releases of the Windows NT operating system (OS) that
          have been developed by Microsoft since 1993. The first release under
          this brand name is Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, an edition of
          Windows NT 3.1. With the release of Windows Server 2003, Microsoft
          started releasing new versions under the name Windows Server. The
          latest release of Windows NT under the Windows Server brand is Windows
          Server 2025. The User Interface of Windows Server operating systems
          has changed with the mainstream Windows versions, with little
          difference in the GUI.

          Windows Phone 8 is the second generation of the Windows Phone mobile
          operating system from Microsoft. It was released on October 29, 2012,
          and, like its predecessor, it features a flat user interface based on
          the Metro design language. Windows Phone 8.1 is the third generation
          of Microsoft Mobile's Windows Phone mobile operating system,
          succeeding Windows Phone 8. Windows Phone 8.1 was rolled out at
          Microsoft's Build Conference in San Francisco, California on April 2,
          2014, and was released in final form to Windows Phone developers on
          April 14, 2014, reaching general availability on August 4, 2014. All
          Windows Phones running Windows Phone 8 can be upgraded to Windows
          Phone 8.1, with release dependent on carrier rollout dates.

          Windows Phone 8 replaces the Windows CE-based architecture used in
          Windows Phone 7 with the Windows NT kernel found in Windows 8. Because
          of this, Windows Phone 7 devices cannot run or update to Windows Phone
          8, and new applications compiled specifically for Windows Phone 8 are
          not made available for Windows Phone 7 devices. Developers can make
          their apps available on both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8
          devices by targeting both platforms via the proper SDKs in Visual
          Studio. Windows Phone 8.1 is also the last version that uses the
          Windows Phone brand name as it was succeeded by Windows 10 Mobile.
          Some Windows Phone 8.1 devices are capable of being upgraded to
          Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft delayed the upgrade and reduced the
          supported device list from their initial promise. Support has ended
          for Windows Phone 8 on January 12, 2016 and Windows Phone 8.1 on July
          11, 2017.

          Windows 10 Mobile is a discontinued mobile operating system developed
          by Microsoft Mobile. It is the successor to Windows Phone 8.1, but was

          Windows 10 Mobile aimed to provide greater consistency with its
          counterpart for PCs, including more extensive synchronization of
          content, Universal Windows Platform apps, as well as the capability,
          on supported hardware, to connect devices to an external display and
          use a desktop interface with mouse and keyboard input support
          (reminiscent of Windows on PCs). Microsoft built tools for developers
          to port iOS Objective-C apps with minimal modifications. Windows Phone
          8.1 smartphones are eligible for upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile,
          pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support. Some features vary
          depending on hardware compatibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 10 Mobile was designed for use on smartphones and phablets
          running on 32-bit ARM processor architectures. Microsoft also intended
          for the platform to be used on ARM tablets with screens 9 inches or
          smaller in size, but such devices were rarely commercially released.
          Windows 10 Mobile entered public beta for selected Lumia smartphones
          on February 12, 2015. The first Lumia smartphones powered by Windows
          10 Mobile were released on November 20, 2015, while eligible Windows
          Phone devices began receiving updates to Windows 10 Mobile on March
          17, 2016, pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support.
        </p>

        <p>
          The platform never achieved any significant degree of popularity or
          market share in comparison to Android or iOS. By 2017, Microsoft had
          already begun to downplay Windows 10 Mobile, having discontinued
          active development (beyond maintenance releases) due to a lack of user
          and developer interest in the platform, and focused on serving
          incumbent mobile operating systems as part of its software and
          services strategy. Support for Windows 10 Mobile ended on January 14,
          2020. As of November 2021, Windows 10 Mobile had approximately a 0.01%
          share of the mobile operating system market.

        <p>
          MS-DOS (/ˌɛmˌɛsˈdɒs/ em-es-DOSS; acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating
          System, also known as Microsoft DOS) is an operating system for
          x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft.
          Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and a few
          operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are
          sometimes referred to as "DOS" (which is also the generic acronym for
          disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM
          PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually
          superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface
          (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows
          operating system.

          <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
          <p>Developed from: 86-DOS</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its
          PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel
          by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in
          1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax and
          capabilities. Beginning in 1988 with DR-DOS, several competing
          products were released for the x86 platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on
          computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the
          operating system, but application software and user data as well.
          Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage
          media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature
          support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer
          architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft's
          development from a programming language company to a diverse software
          development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and
          marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system
          on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. MS-DOS went through
          eight versions, until development ceased in 2000; version 6.22 from
          1994 was the final standalone version, with versions 7 and 8 serving
          mostly in the background for loading Windows 9x.
