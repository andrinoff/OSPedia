        Windows 3.1 is a major release of Microsoft Windows. It was released to
        manufacturing on April 6, 1992, as a successor to Windows 3.0. Like its
        predecessors, the Windows 3.1 series run as a shell on top of MS-DOS; it
        was the last Windows 16-bit operating environment as all future versions
        of Windows had moved to 32-bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TrueType font system was introduced in Windows 3.1 as a competitor
        to Adobe Type Manager. Its multimedia was also expanded, and
        screensavers were introduced, alongside new software such as Windows
        Media Player and Sound Recorder. File Manager and Control Panel received
        tweaks, and Windows 3.1 saw the introduction of the Windows Registry and
        add-ons. It could even utilize more memory than its predecessors.

        Microsoft also released special versions of Windows 3.1 throughout 1992
        and 1993; in Europe and Japan, Windows 3.1 was introduced with more
        language support. In November 1993, Windows 3.11 was released as a minor
        update, while Windows 3.2 was released as a Simplified Chinese version
        of Windows 3.1. Microsoft also introduced Windows for Workgroups, the
        first version of Windows to allow integrated networking. Mostly oriented
        towards businesses, it received network improvements and it allowed
        users to share files, use print servers, and chat online, while it also
        introduced peer-to-peer networking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The series is considered to be an improvement on its predecessors. It
        was praised for its reinvigoration of the user interface and technical
        design. Windows 3.1 sold over three million copies during the first
        three months of its release, although its counterpart Windows for
        Workgroups was noted as a "business disappointment" due to its small
        amount of sold copies. It was succeeded by Windows 95, and Microsoft
        ended the support for Windows 3.1 series on December 31, 2001, except
        for the embedded version, which was retired in 2008.

        <p>
          Windows 3.0, the predecessor of 3.1, was released in 1990, and is
          considered to be the first version of Windows to receive critical
          acclaim. Windows 3.0 received around 10 million sales before the
          release of Windows 3.1 on April 6, 1992. Microsoft began a television
          advertising campaign for the first time on March 1, 1992. The
          advertisements, developed by Ogilvy & Mather, were designed to
          introduce a broader audience to Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 3.1 was codenamed Janus. Like its predecessors, the operating
          environment runs as a shell on top of MS-DOS, although it does not
          include the MS-DOS Executive shell. After the introduction of Windows
          1.0, Microsoft had worked on gaining support from companies to expand
          its operating environment on different types of PCs. Tandy Corporation
          was open to shipping Tandy Sensation PCs with the Windows 3.1
          operating environment. IBM and its PCs were also provided with Windows
          3.1.

        <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
        <p>
          Further enhancements were introduced in Windows 3.1. The TrueType font
          system was introduced to provide scalable fonts to Windows
          applications, without having to resort on using third-party technology
          such as Adobe Type Manager (ATM). Windows 3.1 introduced Arial,
          Courier New, and Times New Roman fonts, in regular, bold, italic, and
          bold-italic versions, which could be scaled to any size and rotated,
          depending on the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve user interaction, Microsoft initiated warning and event
          sounds, and introduced computer command shortcuts for copy, cut, and
          paste. Windows 3.1 is also noted for its improvement of multimedia;
          screensavers, Windows Media Player, and Sound Recorder were introduced
          into the operating environment. These features were already present on
          the Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions version, although they were
          only available to users with newly bought PCs. The Media Player could
          play MIDI music files and AVI video files, while the Sound Recorder
          could play, record, and edit sound files that were affiliated with the
          WAV format.  Minesweeper was officially introduced in Windows 3.1 as a
          replacement for Reversi, alongside Solitaire. MS-DOS programs were
          previously not able to be controlled with a mouse; this ended up being
          introduced in Windows 3.1. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) was
          added to allow drag-and-drop embedding of images and formatted text
          between Windows programs. SVGA color support was also introduced in
          this version.
        </p>
        <p>
          File Manager had also received tweaks; split view-mode was introduced,
          users were now able to browse files without having to open separate
          windows, while files were able to be dragged and dropped to other
          locations on the system. An option for quick formatting was introduced
          to format floppy disks and copy its files without having to quit
          Windows. File Manager is an MDI application that is used for moving,
          deleting, and managing files on the system. Microsoft also built
          Microsoft Bob, a utility that would act as a search assistant, on
          Windows 3.1, only for it to be released on Windows 95 in 1995. The
          introduction of Windows Registry, a centralized database that could
          store configuration information and settings for various operating
          systems components and applications, also occurred in this version.
          The Control Panel also received changes; its items were now
          hard-coded, and additional items could be added by placing additional
          .cpl files. Similarly, the Calendar uses the .cal extension. Printer
          management tasks were moved over to Control Panel and Print Manager.
          Several printer drivers were improved in Windows 3.1, making the Print
          Manager more efficient to use.  Windows 3.1 also includes
          troubleshooting and diagnostic tools such as the Dr. Watson utility
          which saves information about application errors, and Microsoft
          Diagnostics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows 3.1 also includes add-ons; Video for Windows was introduced in
          November 1992 as a reaction to Apple's QuickTime technology. At the
          price of $200, the software included editing and encoding programs. It
          was later built into Windows 95. Microsoft also published Windows for
          Pen Computing, a pen computing interface which was created in response
          to PenPoint OS by GO Corporation. The operating environment was also
          given limited compatibility with the then-new 32-bit Windows API, by
          introducing Win32s, an enabling technology. Microsoft also provided
          WinG, an application program interface, to entice developers to move
          from DOS to Windows. It also provided a device-independent interface
          to graphics and printer hardware, and allowed programs to have both
          read and write capabilities to the WinGDC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike all previous versions, Windows 3.1 could not run in real mode
          and it insisted on the use of 80286 processors or above. Because of
          this, the maximum memory available was increased. While Windows 3.0
          was limited to 16 MB maximum memory, Windows 3.1 could access a
          theoretical 4 GB in the 386 enhanced mode. The actual practical
          ceiling is 256 MB. Like its predecessors, it runs as a 16-bit system;
          Windows 3.1 is also the last Windows to run in 16-bit mode. It is also
          the first Windows to be distributed on a CD-ROM. The setup interface
          was simplified; express mode was introduced to automatically set up
          Windows. Windows 3.1 also includes an online tutorial applet for users
          regarding the use of the Windows 3.1 user interface. In addition it
          supported the Advanced Power Management standard.

        <p>
          A special version named "Windows 3.1 for Central and Eastern Europe"
          introduced eleven languages to Windows 3.1. It also provided support
          for the Cyrillic script. To use Czech, Hungarian, and Polish
          terminologies this version was required, while to use Russian
          terminologies a Russian version of Windows 3.1 was needed. Similarly,
          Microsoft also released Windows 3.1J with support for Japanese, which
          shipped 1.46 million copies in its first year on the market (1993) in
          Japan.
        </p>

        <span class="bolden">Modular Windows</span>
        <p>
          Modular Windows was built for real-time consumer electronics, and was
          designed to be controlled via television. It was a special version of
          Windows 3.1, which was designed to run on Tandy Video Information
          System; it allowed users to run multimedia software without having to
          buy a personal computer. It also contained a software development kit
          (SDK) for programmers to write applications that would run on devices
          that have Modular Windows. The SDK was sold for $99. Modular Windows
          was discontinued in 1994.
        </p>

        <span class="bolden">Windows 3.11</span>
        <p>
          Released on November 8, 1993, Windows 3.11 was introduced with fixes
          for network problems which were present on Windows 3.1 As a minor
          update, new features were not present in this version. It also did not
          run on IBM's OS/2 for Windows. Windows 3.11 allowed users to connect
          to each other as peers to share the resources of their computers.
          Microsoft replaced all retail and OEM versions of Windows 3.1 with
          Windows 3.11 and provided a free upgrade to anyone who owned Windows
          3.1.
        </p>

        <span class="bolden">Windows 3.2</span>
        <p>
          An updated Simplified Chinese version of Windows 3.1 was released in
          November 1993, as Windows 3.2. The update was limited to this language
          version, as it only fixed issues related to the complex input system
          for the Simplified Chinese language. A font editor is present in
          Windows 3.2; it is used to add new Chinese characters to the
          already-existing fonts.
        </p>

        <span class="bolden">Windows for Workgroups</span>
        <p>
          Windows for Workgroups served as an update to Windows 3.1, and it was
          the first version of Windows that was suitable for integrated
          networking. Initially developed as an add-on for Windows 3.0, it was
          later released in 1992. It introduced drivers and protocols for
          peer-to-peer networking. Windows for Workgroups was mostly oriented
          towards businesses. The two vesion released are:

              >Windows for Workgroups 3.11</span
            >
            <p>
              The first version of Windows for Workgroups, 3.1, was released on
              October 27, 1992. Codenamed Winball and Sparta, it allows users to
              share files, use print servers, and chat online; files could be
              accessed from other machines that run either Windows or DOS. The
              Microsoft Hearts card game was also added, while Object Linking
              and Embedding, which was implemented in Windows 3.1, was also
              included in the Windows for Workgroups version. The Workgroups
              version also introduced the Microsoft Mail program, which allowed
              users to receive and send emails, and Microsoft Schedule+, a time
              management app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Windows for Workgroups could also be accessed from an OS/2 client
              that uses the Server Message Block (SMB), a protocol used for
              sharing files and printers over local networks. It introduced
              support for the NetBEUI protocol. The price sat at $69 for Windows
              3.1 users.

            <p>
              The other version, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, was released on
              November 8, 1993. It was codenamed Snowball, and it introduced
              support for 32-bit file access, drive sharing, and group
              calendaring. It also has built-in fax capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              It received network improvements; a Winsock package was released
              for Windows for Workgroups, although it was later replaced by a
              32-bit stack add-on package (codenamed Wolverine) that provided
              TCP/IP support in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Its connectivity
              with NetWare networks was increased, while it also introduced
              support for Open Data-Link Interface cards and Internetwork Packet
              Exchange drivers. Remote access service was introduced as a
              product for users to remotely access Windows NT and its Advanced
              Server networks.
            </p>
            <p>
              It runs in 80386 enhanced mode, and it supports the use of network
              redirectors. It was sold in two versions; the complete package
              cost $219 while the "Workgroup Add-on for Windows" cost $69.

          Windows 3.1 changed some icons, of which the most notable change is
          the addition of color to icons. Some icons changed include the ones
          for File Manager, Control Panel, Paint, Notepad and Calculator.<!--  Generated by Gemini -->

        <p>
          Windows 3.1 introduced TrueType font support, therefore making fonts
          clearer at any size. They were vector fonts, which meant that they
          used mathematical equations to define the size of every letter, so
          they could be scaled to any size without losing quality. Before
          TrueType fonts, bitmap fonts were used which were made on a grid of
          pixels, causing them to become jagged and / or pixelated on increasing
          their size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many features from the Mutimedia Extensions pack for Windows 3.0 were
          integrated into Windows 3.1. One of those programs was Media Player,
          which could play WAV and MIDI audio files and AVI video files. Sound
          Recorder was also added, allowing users to record and edit audio
          files.
