        Windows Me (Millennium Edition) is an operating system developed by
        Microsoft as the last operating system in the Windows 9x series of
        Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was the successor to Windows 98,
        and was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, and to retail on
        September 14, 2000. It was Microsoft's main operating system for home
        users and quickly replaced by its successor Windows XP on October 25,
        2001.

        Windows Me was targeted specifically at home PC users, and included
        Internet Explorer 5.5, which could later be upgraded to Internet
        Explorer 6; Windows Media Player 7, which could later be upgraded to
        Windows Media Player 9 Series; DirectX 7, which could later be upgraded
        to DirectX 9; and the new Windows Movie Maker software, which provided
        basic video editing and was designed to be easy to use for consumers.
        Microsoft also incorporated features first introduced in Windows 2000,
        which had been released as a business-oriented operating system seven
        months earlier, into the graphical user interface, shell and Windows
        Explorer. Although Windows Me was still based on MS-DOS like its
        predecessors, access to real-mode DOS was restricted to decrease system
        boot time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows Me was initially positively received when it was released, but
        it quickly recieved a more infamous reputation from many users due to
        lots of stability problems. In October 2001, Windows XP was released to
        the public, having already been under development at the time of Windows
        Me's release, and incorporated most, but not all, of the features of
        Windows Me, while still being far more stable due to being based on the
        Windows NT kernel. Mainstream support for Windows Me ended on December
        31, 2003, followed by extended support on July 11, 2006.

        <p>
          At the 1998 Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, Microsoft CEO
          Bill Gates stated that Windows 98 would be the last iteration of
          Windows to use the Windows 9x kernel, with the intention for the next
          consumer-focused version to be based on the Windows NT kernel,
          unifying the two branches of Windows. However, it soon became apparent
          that the development work involved was too great to meet the aim of
          releasing before the end of 2000, particularly given the ongoing
          parallel work on the eventually-canceled Neptune project. The Consumer
          Windows development team was therefore re-tasked with improving
          Windows 98 while porting some of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000.
          Microsoft President Steve Ballmer publicly announced these changes at
          the next Windows HEIC in 1999.
        </p>
        <p>
          On July 23, 1999, the first alpha version of Windows Me was released
          to testers. Known as Development Preview 1, it was very similar to
          Windows 98 SE, with the only major change being a very early iteration
          of the new Help and Support feature that would appear in the final
          version. Three more Development Previews were released over the
          subsequent two months.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first beta version was released to testers and the industry press
          on September 24, 1999, with the second coming on November 24 that
          year. Beta 2 showed the first real changes from Windows 98, including
          importing much of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000, and the removal
          of real-mode DOS. Industry expert Paul Thurrott reviewed Beta 2 upon
          release and spoke positively of it in a review. By early 2000, Windows
          Me was reportedly behind schedule, and an interim build containing the
          new automatic update feature was released to allay concerns about a
          delayed-release.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2000, Paul Thurrott revealed that Microsoft had planned to
          exclude Windows Me, as well as new releases of Windows NT 4.0, from CD
          shipments for MSDN subscribers. The reason given in the case of Me was
          that the OS was designed for consumers. However, Thurrott alleged that
          the real motivation behind both case to force software developers to
          move to Windows 2000. Three days later, following a write-in and
          call-in campaign by hundreds of readers, Microsoft announced that
          Windows Me (including development versions) would ship to MSDN
          subscribers after all. Microsoft also apologized personally to
          Thurrott, claiming he received misinformation, though in a follow-up
          article he stated that it was "clear that the decision [...] actually
          changed".
        </p>
        <p>
          Beta 3 was released on April 11, 2000, and this version marked the
          first appearance of its final startup and shutdown sounds derived from
          Windows 2000, as the previous betas used Windows 98's startup and
          shutdown sounds.
        </p>

        <span style="font-size: 2.2vh; font-weight: 800">Release</span>
        <p>
          Although Microsoft signed off on the final build of Windows Me on June
          28, 2000, after trialing three Release Candidate builds with testers,
          the final retail release was pushed back to September 14 for reasons
          that were not clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after Windows Me was released to manufacturing on June 19,
          2000, Microsoft launched a marketing campaign to promote it in the
          U.S., which they dubbed the Meet Me Tour. A national partnered
          promotional program featured the new OS, OEMs and other partners in an
          interactive multimedia attraction in 25 cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows Me was released for retail sale on September 14, 2000.At
          launch time, Microsoft announced a time-limited promotion from
          September 2000 to January 2001 which entitled Windows 98 and Windows
          98 SE users to upgrade to Windows Me for $59.95 instead of the regular
          retail upgrade price of $109. Non-upgrade versions cost $209, the same
          as Windows 98 on its release. In October 2001, Microsoft released
          Windows XP, which also included the ZIP folders, the Spider Solitaire
          game and Internet Explorer 6 by default, all while being based on the
          Windows NT kernel, which on XP was an evolution of the one in Windows
          2000.

          <summary class="level-two">Hardware support improvements</summary>

          <p>
            Faster boot times: Windows Me features numerous improvements for
            improving cold boot time, pre and post-logon boot times and time
            required for resuming from hibernation. Processing of real mode
            configuration files, CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, is bypassed at
            startup and essential real mode drivers like HIMEM.SYS and
            SMARTDRV.EXE are embedded into IO.SYS. The registry is loaded only
            once; for efficient loading, the registry is split into three files
            instead of two (SYSTEM.DAT and USER.DAT), with the new file
            CLASSES.DAT containing the contents of the hive HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
            required for boot loaded initially. Plug and Play device enumeration
            is more parallelized than in Windows 98. Boot time is not affected
            due to unavailability of a DHCP server or other network components.
            There are also optimizations to prevent boot slowdown due to BIOS
            POST operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            USB Human Interface Device Class: Generic support for 5-button mice
            is also included as standard and installing IntelliPoint allows
            reassigning the programmable buttons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Windows Image Acquisition: Windows Me introduced the Windows Image
            Acquisition API for a standardized method of allowing Windows
            applications to transparently and more easily communicate with image
            acquisition devices, such as digital cameras and scanners. WIA
            intended to improve the configuration and the user interface for
            interacting with scanners and such devices, (which were previously
            supported by the TWAIN standard) and simplify writing device drivers
            for developers. WIA also includes support for USB still image
            capture device classes such as scanners and cameras through the
            Picture Transfer Protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improved power management and suspend/resume operations: The OEM
            version of Windows Me supports OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state
            (hibernation) and other power management features without
            manufacturer-supplied drivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            USB and FireWire support improvements: Windows Me is the only
            operating system in the Windows 9x series that includes generic
            drivers for USB mass storage devices and USB printers. Support for
            FireWire SBP-2 scanners and storage devices is also improved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The waveOut, DirectSound, and DirectShow APIs support non-PCM
            formats such as AC-3 or WMA over S/PDIF.

            <li>
              Windows Movie Maker: This utility is based on DirectShow and
              Windows Media technologies to provide Microsoft Windows computer
              systems with basic video capture and edit capabilities. It
              provides users with the ability to capture, edit, and re-encode
              media content into the Windows Media format, a tightly compressed
              format that requires a minimal amount of storage space on the
              computer's hard disk when compared to many other media formats.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Media Player 7: The new version of the Windows multimedia
              player software introduces jukebox functionality featuring the
              Media Library, support for CD burning, an integrated media
              encoder, and the ability to transfer music directly to portable
              devices. Another new feature is its radio tuner that can be used
              to search for and connect to radio stations over the internet.
              Users can also customize the look and feel of the user interface
              through interactive skins. Windows Me can be upgraded to Windows
              Media Player 9 Series, which was later included in Windows XP SP2.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows DVD Player: The software DVD player in Windows Me is a
              redesigned version of the one featured in Windows 98 which, unlike
              its predecessor, does not require a dedicated decoder card for DVD
              playback. Instead, it supports software decoding through a
              third-party decoder.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Net Crawler: Windows Me introduced a net crawling feature which
              automatically searches out and creates shortcuts to network shares
              and printers in My Network Places. This can be controlled using
              the Automatically search for network folders and printers option.
              Shortcuts that are added by the net crawler but not detected again
              on the network in a reasonable time period are aged out and
              deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              New TCP/IP Stack: Windows Me includes the Windows 2000 networking
              stack and architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Home Networking Wizard is designed to help users to set up a
              computer that is running Windows Me for use on a small home
              network. This includes setting up Internet Connection Sharing
              (ICS) on a computer running Windows Me so the computer can share a
              connection to the Internet with other computers on the home
              network.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dial-up Networking component was updated in Windows Me and
              provides several enhancements while maintaining the desired
              features of prior releases of the operating system. The user
              interface had been reworked to provide all configurable parameters
              in one convenient location. The user interface now included three
              new tabs: Networking, Security and Dialing. To improve dial-up
              networking, Windows Me includes built-in support for the
              Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the Connection Manager
              Administration Kit (an optional networking component in Windows
              2000 Server), network administrators can pre-configure and deploy
              dial-up networking connections, by means of a Connection Manager
              service profile, to Windows Me–based client machines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) version 5.0 for
              Windows Me was enhanced to provide programming interface parity
              with NDIS version 5.0 in Windows 2000 (the programming interfaces
              used by network device drivers are the same for both platforms).
            </li>
            <li>
              Universal Plug and Play: Windows Me introduced support for
              Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Universal Plug and Play and NAT
              traversal APIs can also be installed on Windows 98 and Windows 98
              SE by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard.

          <ul>
            <li>
              System Restore: Windows Me introduced the "System Restore" logging
              and reversion system, which was meant to simplify troubleshooting
              and solve problems. It was intended to work as a rollback and
              recovery feature so that if the installation of an application or
              a driver adversely affected the system, the user could undo the
              installation and return the system to a previously working state.
              It does this by monitoring changes to Windows system files and the
              registry. System Restore protects only the operating system files,
              not documents, and therefore is not a substitute for a backup
              program.
            </li>
            <li>
              System File Protection: First introduced with Windows 2000 (as
              Windows File Protection), and expanding on the capabilities
              introduced with System File Checker in Windows 98, System File
              Protection aimed to protect system files from modification and
              corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is
              in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows Me
              to silently restore the original copy. The original is taken from
              a hard drive backup folder (%WinDir%\Options\Install) or from the
              Windows Me installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the
              hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive,
              a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that
              the CD be inserted. System File Protection is a different
              technology from System Restore and should not be confused with the
              latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files
              including added applications and user configuration data stored
              repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user,
              whereas System File Protection protects operating system files
              with no user input.
            </li>
            <li>
              System Configuration Utility allows users to manually extract and
              restore individual system files from the Windows Me setup files.
              It has also been updated with three new tabs called "Static VxDs",
              "Environment" and "International". The Static VxDs tab allows
              users to enable or disable static virtual device drivers to be
              loaded at startup, the Environment tab allows users to enable or
              disable environment variables, and the International tab allows
              users to set international language keyboard layout settings that
              were formerly set via the real mode MS-DOS configuration files. A
              Cleanup button on the Startup tab allows cleaning up invalid or
              deleted startup entries.
            </li>
            <li>
              System Monitor has been updated with a Dial-Up Adapter section.
              Users can now monitor items such as Connection Speeds, Bytes
              Received or Transmitted / Second.

            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic Updates: The Automatic Updates utility automatically
              downloads and installs critical updates from the Windows Update
              Web site with little user interaction. It is set up to check
              Windows Update once every 24 hours by default. Users can choose to
              download which update they want, although high-priority updates
              must be downloaded and installed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compressed Folders: Windows Me includes native support for ZIP
              files through the 'Compressed Folders' Explorer extension. This
              extension was originally introduced in the Plus! 98 collection for
              Windows 98, but is included in the base operating system in
              Windows Me.

              A new Help and Support program has also been added, replacing the
              HTML Help-based documentation in Windows 2000 and Windows 98. The
              Help and Support Center is entirely HTML-based and takes advantage
              of a technology called Support Automation Framework (SAF), that
              can show support information from the internet, allows collecting
              data for troubleshooting via WMI and scripting and for third
              parties to plug into Windows Help and Support. Several other
              support tools also shipped with Windows Me.

              Windows Me also includes Internet Explorer 5.5, which supports a
              new Print Preview feature. It also shipped with the MSN Messenger
              Service.

          <span class="level-two">Real mode DOS</span>

          <p>
            Windows Me restricted support for real mode MS-DOS. As a result,
            IO.SYS in Windows Me disregards CONFIG.SYS, COMMAND.COM and WIN.COM
            and directly executes VMM32.VXD. In its default configuration the
            system would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to
            DOS from Windows; real mode drivers such as ANSI.SYS could not be
            loaded and older applications that require real mode could not be
            run. Microsoft argued that the change improved the speed and
            reliability of the boot process.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Windows Me, the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are used only
            to set global environment variables. The two files (if present) are
            scanned for settings relating to the environment variables, and any
            other commands present are moved into a Windows registry key (see
            below). The two files thus contain only settings and preferences
            which configure the "global environment" for the computer during the
            boot phase or when starting a new virtual DOS machine (VDM).
          </p>

          <p>
            To specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would
            be present in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) the user must edit the
            following Windows registry key:
          </p>

          <code
            >HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\Environment</code
          >
          <p>
            For troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM
            and the Windows Me startup disk (a user-creatable floppy disk, known
            as the Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode
            MS-DOS.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through
            various unofficial means. Additionally, a registry setting exists
            that re-enables the "Restart in MS-DOS mode" option in the shutdown
            dialog box; however, unless patched unofficially with third-party
            software, Windows Me cannot be booted to MS-DOS real mode.
          </p>

          <span class="level-two">Other components</span>
          <p>
            Unlike previous versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely
            aimed at home users, and thus had certain enterprise-oriented
            features removed. Several features of its predecessors did not work
            or were officially unsupported by Microsoft on Windows Me, including
            Automated Installation, Active Directory client services, System
            Policy Editor, Personal Web Server and ASP. These features were
            supported on the previous versions of Windows 9x. A Resource Kit
            publication, targeted towards system administrators, was never
            published for Windows Me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other features that were removed or never updated to work with
            Windows Me included Microsoft Fax, QuickView and DriveSpace, as well
            as the GUI FAT32 conversion tool. Several Windows Explorer commands
            were also modified in Windows Me, matching the menu structure in
            Windows 2000. While some were simply moved to a different location,
            certain functionality of the Go menu, as well as the Find command on
            the Tools menu, are no longer available. For the latter change
            Microsoft recommends using a variety of similar functionality
            labeled Search.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Active Channels Channel bar from the original release of Windows
            98 was removed like with Windows 98 Second Edition and is not
            installed upon first boot, but is retained if upgrading from the
            original release of Windows 98 to Windows 98 Second Edition or
            Windows Me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows Me, like Windows 98 Second Edition, did not ship with the
            WinG API or RealPlayer 4.0, unlike the original release of Windows
            98, due to both of these having been superseded by DirectX and
            Windows Media Player, respectively.

        <p>
          Windows Me featured the shell enhancements inherited from Windows 2000
          such as personalized menus, customizable Windows Explorer toolbars,
          auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, Windows
          2000 advanced file type association features, displaying comments in
          shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view
          (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in
          Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, Places bar in
          common dialogs for Open and Save, cascading Start menu special
          folders, some Plus! 95 and Plus! 98 themes, and updated graphics. The
          notification area in Windows Me and later supported 16-bit high color
          icons. The Multimedia control panel was also updated from Windows 98.
          Taskbar and Start Menu options allowed disabling of the drag and drop
          feature and could prevent moving or resizing the taskbar, which was
          easier for new users.
