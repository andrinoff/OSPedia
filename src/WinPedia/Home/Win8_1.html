        This webpage does not have a section on editions as there is no
        information on Wikipedia about its editions. The four editions are the
        base edition (simply branded as Windows 8.1), Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows
        8.1 Enterprise, and Windows RT 8.1 (designed for tablet PCs and other
        mobile devices with ARM processors.

        Windows 8.1 is a release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
        Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on August 27, 2013, and
        broadly released for retail sale on October 17, 2013, about a year after
        the retail release of its predecessor, and succeeded by Windows 10 on
        July 29, 2015. Windows 8.1 was made available for download via MSDN and
        Technet and available as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8
        and Windows RT users via the Windows Store. A server version, Windows
        Server 2012 R2, was released on October 18, 2013.

        Windows 8.1 aimed to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers
        on launch. Enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional
        snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly
        SkyDrive) integration, Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), a Bing-powered
        unified search system, restoration of a visible Start button on the
        taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the
        user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also
        added support for then emerging technologies like high-resolution
        displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as
        the ReFS file system.

        <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
        <p>
          In February 2013, ZDNet writer Mary Jo Foley disclosed potential
          rumors about "Blue", the codename for a wave of planned updates across
          several Microsoft products and services, including Windows 8, Windows
          Phone 8, Outlook.com, and SkyDrive. In particular, the report detailed
          that Microsoft was planning to shift to a more "continuous"
          development model, which would see major revisions to its main
          software platforms released on a consistent yearly cycle to keep up
          with market demands. Lending credibility to the reports, Foley noted
          that a Microsoft staff member had listed experience with "Windows
          Blue" on his LinkedIn profile, and listed it as a separate operating
          system from 8.
        </p>

        <p>
          A post-RTM build of Windows 8, build 9364, was leaked in March 2013.
          The build, which was believed to be of "Windows Blue", revealed a
          number of enhancements across Windows 8's interface, including
          additional size options for tiles, expanded color options on the Start
          screen, the expansion of PC Settings to include more options that were
          previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, the ability for
          apps to snap to half of the screen, the ability to take screenshots
          from the Share charm, additional stock apps, increased SkyDrive
          integration (such as automatic device backups) and Internet Explorer
          11. Shortly afterward on March 26, 2013, corporate vice president of
          corporate communications Frank X. Shaw officially acknowledged the
          "Blue" project, stating that continuous development would be "the new
          normal" at Microsoft, and that "Our product groups are also taking a
          unified planning approach so people get what they want—all of their
          devices, apps and services working together wherever they are and for
          whatever they are doing."

        <p>
          On April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the Windows 8.1 Update, which
          included all past updates plus new features, unveiled by Microsoft
          vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23,
          2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2.
          Belfiore noted that the update would lower the minimum system
          requirements for Windows, so it can be installed on devices with as
          little as 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself,
          this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must
          be installed in order to receive any further patches.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the 2014 Build conference, during April, Microsoft's Terry Myerson
          unveiled further GUI changes for Windows 8.1, including the ability to
          run Metro-style apps inside desktop windows, and a revised Start menu,
          which creates a compromise between the Start menu design used by
          Windows 7 and the Start screen, by combining the application listing
          in the first column with a second that can be used to display app
          tiles, whereas Windows 8.0 used a screen hotspot ("hot corner").
          Myerson stated that these changes would occur in a future update, but
          did not elaborate further. A distinction is the removal of the tooltip
          with the preview thumbnail of the Start screen.

        <p>
          Many of the changes on Windows 8.1, particularly to the user
          interface, were made in response to criticisms from early adopters and
          other critics after the release of Windows 8.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Apps</summary>
          <p>
            The suite of pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in
            Windows 8.1; PC Settings was expanded to include options that were
            previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was
            updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic
            updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional
            features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating
            panoramas, and additional editing tools were added to the Photos app
            (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed).
            A number of additional stock apps were also added, including
            Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder,
            Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from
            apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users,
            Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included
            Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support data loss
            protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with
            information rights management. Windows Store is enabled by default
            within Windows To Go environments. On January 31, 2020, Microsoft
            released the new Microsoft Edge web browser for Windows 8.1.

          <summary class="level-two">Online services and functionality</summary>
          <p>
            Windows 8.1 adds tighter integration with several Microsoft-owned
            services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated at the system
            level to sync user settings and files. Files are automatically
            downloaded in the background when they are accessed from the user's
            OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to be available offline. By
            default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and
            reparse points are used to give the appearance of a normal directory
            structure to provide backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was
            updated to include a local file manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1
            requires that a user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft
            account; the previous SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have
            this requirement) is not supported on Windows 8.1.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Bing-based unified search system was added; it can analyze a
            user's search habits to return results featuring relevant local and
            online content. Full-screen "hero" displays aggregate news articles,
            Wikipedia entries, multimedia, and other content related to a search
            query; for instance, searching for a music performer would return
            photos of the performer, a biography, and their available songs and
            albums on Xbox Music. The messaging app from Windows 8 has been
            replaced by Skype, which also allows users to accept calls directly
            from the lock screen. Windows 8.1 also includes Internet Explorer
            11, which adds support for SPDY and WebGL, and expanded developer
            tools. The Metro-style variant of IE11 also adds tab syncing, the
            ability to open an unlimited number of tabs, and Reading List
            integration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is
            disabled in all bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.

          </summary>
          <p>
            On compatible hardware, Windows 8.1 also features a transparent
            "device encryption" system based on BitLocker. Encryption begins as
            soon as a user begins using the system; the recovery key is stored
            to either the user's Microsoft account or an Active Directory login,
            allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device
            encryption is offered on all editions of Windows 8.1 unlike
            BitLocker (which is exclusive to the Pro and Enterprise editions),
            device encryption requires that the device meet the Connected
            Standby specification and have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0
            chip. Windows 8.1 also introduces improved fingerprint recognition
            APIs, which allows user login, User Account Control, Windows Store
            and Windows Store apps to use enrolled fingerprints as an
            authentication method. A new kiosk mode known as "Assigned Access"
            was also added, allowing a device to be configured to use a single
            app in a restricted environment. Additionally, Windows Defender
            includes an intrusion detection system which can scan network
            activity for signs of malware. Windows 8.1 also allows third-party
            VPN clients to automatically trigger connections.
          </p>

          <p>
            For enterprise device management, Windows 8.1 adds support for the
            Workplace Join feature of Windows Server 2012 R2, which allows users
            to enroll their own device into corporate networks with finer
            control over access to resources and security requirements. Windows
            8.1 also supports the OMA Device Management specifications. Remote
            Data Control can be used to remotely wipe specific "corporate" data
            from Windows 8.1 devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 64-bit variants of Windows 8.1 no longer support processors
            which do not implement the double-width compare and exchange
            (CMPXCHG16B) CPU instruction (which the installer reports as a lack
            of support for "CompareExchange128"). A Microsoft spokesperson noted
            that the change primarily affects systems with older AMD 64-bit
            processors, and that "the number of affected processors are
            extremely small since this instruction has been supported for
            greater than 10 years." It mostly concerns Socket 754 and Socket 939
            Athlon 64 from 2004 and 2005; the Socket AM2 CPUs should all have
            the instruction. Brad Chacos of PC World also reported a case in
            which Windows 8.1 rejected Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 and a Q9550S
            despite their support for this instruction, because the associated
            Intel DP35DP motherboard did not. These changes do not affect the
            32-bit variants of Windows 8.1.

            Windows 8.1 adds support for 3D printing, pairing with printers
            using NFC tags, Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast media streaming, tethering,
            and NVMe. In response to the increasing pixel density in displays,
            Windows 8.1 can scale text and GUI elements up to 200% (whereas
            Windows 8 supported only 150%) and set scaling settings
            independently on each display in multi-monitor configurations.

            Backup and Restore, the backup component of Windows that had been
            deprecated but was available in Windows 8 through a Control Panel
            applet called "Windows 7 File Recovery", was removed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 8.1 also removes the graphical user interface for the
            Windows System Assessment Tool, meaning that the Windows Experience
            Index is no longer displayed. The command line variant of the tool
            remains available on the system. Microsoft reportedly removed the
            graphical Windows Experience Index in order to promote the idea that
            all kinds of hardware run Windows 8 equally well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 8.1 removed the ability of several Universal Windows
            Platform apps to act as "hubs" connecting similar services within a
            single interface:
          </p>

              The Photos app lost the ability to view photos from Facebook,
              Flickr or SkyDrive (branded as OneDrive since February 2014).
              Instead, each service provider is expected to create its own app.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Messaging app, which was interoperable with Windows Live
              Messenger and Facebook Chat, was deprecated in favor of a Skype
              app that is not compatible with Facebook Chat;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Calendar app can only connect to Microsoft services such as
              Outlook.com and Microsoft Exchange, with support for Google
              Calendar removed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since October 2016, all future patches are cumulative as with
              Windows 10; individual patches can no longer be downloaded.
            </li>

            Users can only upgrade their previous version of Windows to Windows
            8.1 using the revised installer introduced in Windows 8: they can no

        <p>
          The Start screen received several enhancements on Windows 8.1,
          including an extended "All Apps" view with sort modes (accessed by
          clicking a new down arrow button or swiping upward), small and
          extra-large sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program
          shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as
          expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate
          animated elements), and the ability for the Start screen to use the
          desktop background instead. Applications were no longer added to the
          Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now
          have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single
          color). The app snapping system was also extended; up to four apps can
          be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be
          snapped to fill half the screen, and can also be used on any display
          in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a
          snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a
          photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the
          screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in
          a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability
          to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera
          app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete
          mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users
          to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete
          dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing,
          allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends
          and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a
          narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a pop-up
          menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.
        </p>

        <p>
          To improve the usability of the desktop interface, a visible Start
          button was restored to the taskbar for opening the Start screen, and
          the Quick Links menu (accessed by right-clicking the Start button or
          pressing Win+X) now contains shutdown and sign-out options. Users can
          also modify certain user interface behaviors, such as disabling the
          upper hot corners for using the charms and recent apps list, going to
          the desktop instead of the Start screen on login or after closing all
          apps on a screen, automatically opening the "All Apps" view on the
          Start screen when opened, and prioritizing desktop programs on the
          "Category" sort mode on "All Apps". To assist users in learning the
          Windows 8 user interface, an interactive tutorial was also offered,
          along with a new Help + Tips app for additional information. In
          contrast, Windows RT 8.1 downplays the desktop interface further by
          not displaying the Desktop tile on its default Start screen at all
          (however, it can still be manually added to the Start screen).
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen stated that the restoration of the
          visible Start button was intended to be a "warm blanket" for users who
          had become confused by the removal of the button on 8; the Start
          button was originally removed to reflect Windows 8's treatment of the
          desktop as an "app" rather than the main interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further interface behavior changes are made on the April 2014 "Windows
          8.1 Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such
          as desktop and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve
          integration between Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse
          is in use, the Desktop is shown on startup by default, the Start
          screen uses context menus instead of a toolbar across the bottom of
          the screen for manipulating tiles, an autohiding title bar with
          minimize and close buttons is displayed within apps at the top of the
          screen, the taskbar can display and pin apps alongside desktop
          programs and be accessed from within apps, and visible search and
