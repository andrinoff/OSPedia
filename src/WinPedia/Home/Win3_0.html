        Windows 3.0 is the third major release of Microsoft Windows, launched on
        May 22, 1990. It introduces a new graphical user interface (GUI) that
        represents applications as clickable icons, instead of the list of file
        names in its predecessors. Later updates expand capabilities, such as
        multimedia support for sound recording and playback, and support for
        CD-ROMs.

        Windows 3.0 was the first version of Windows to perform well both
        critically and commercially, and was seen as a major improvement over
        its previous offering of Windows 2.0. Its GUI was considered a
        challenger to those used and popularized by the Apple Macintosh and
        Commodore Amiga. Other praised features include improved multitasking,
        customizability, and especially the utilitarian memory management that
        troubled the users of Windows 3.0's predecessors. The software was a
        major success, achieving 10 million sales. However, Microsoft was
        criticized by third-party developers for bundling its separate software
        with the operating environment, which they viewed as an anticompetitive
        practice. Windows 3.0 had many changes from Windows 2.0 and 1.0 like
        adding the File Manager, using the MS-DOS Prompt during your Windows
        session and the Program Manager instead of MS-DOS Executive to launch
        programs.

        <summary class="level-one">Development History</summary>
        <p>
          Before Windows 3.0, a partnership bundled IBM's personal computers
          with Microsoft's MS-DOS since 1981. Microsoft had previous attempted
          to develop a successful operating environment called Windows, which
          IBM declined for its product line. As MS-DOS's fifth iteration
          approached, IBM demanded a version that could run in "protected mode",
          to allow multiple programs at once, among other benefits. MS-DOS was
          originally designed to run in real mode and run only one program at a
          time, due to the limitations of the Intel 8088 microprocessor. Intel
          had later released the Intel 80286, supporting such multitasking
          efficiently (with several different hardware features, including
          memory protection, hardware task switching, program privilege
          separation, and virtual memory, all absent on the earlier Intel x86
          CPUs) and which could be directly connected to 16 times as much memory
          as the 8088 (and 8086). The two companies developed the next
          generation beyond MS-DOS, called OS/2. Early OS/2 software is not
          encumbered with MS-DOS compatibility, giving IBM a technological
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In late 1987, Windows/386 2.0 introduced a protected mode kernel that
          can multitask several MS-DOS applications using virtual 8086 mode, but
          all Windows applications still run in a shared virtual DOS machine. As
          the rest of the Microsoft team moved on to the OS/2 2.0 project, David
          Weise, a member of the Windows development team and a critic of IBM,
          believed that he could restart the Windows project. Microsoft needed
          programming tools to run in protected mode, so it hired Murray
          Sargent, a physics professor from the University of Arizona who had
          developed a DOS extender and a debugging program that works with
          protected mode applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows 3.0 originated in 1988 as an independent project by Weise and
          Sargent, using Sargent's debugger to improve the memory manager and
          run Windows applications in separate protected memory segments. In a
          few months, Weise and Sargent cobbled together a rough prototype to
          run Windows versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, then presented it
          to company executives, who were impressed enough to approve it as an
          official project. When IBM learned of Microsoft's upcoming project,
          their relationship was damaged, but Microsoft asserted that it would
          cancel Windows after its launch and that it would continue to develop
          OS/2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows 3.0 was officially announced worldwide on May 22, 1990, in the
          New York City Center Theater. The event had 6,000 attendees, and it
          was broadcast live in the Microsoft social fairs of seven other North
          American cities and twelve major cities outside. Microsoft spent US$3
          million to host the festivities, which co-founder Bill Gates referred
          to as the "most extravagant, extensive, and expensive software
          introduction ever". Microsoft did not offer free runtime licenses of
          the software to applications vendors, because runtime versions of
          Windows lack multitasking. Instead, the company offered upgrades for
          both full and runtime previous versions of Windows at a cost of US$50
          (equivalent to $117 in 2023)—considerably lower than the full
          license's suggested retail price of $149. The software was bundled by
          computer hardware manufacturers. The first were Zenith Data Systems,
          Austin Computer Systems, and CompuAdd, followed by more than 25
          others, not including IBM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft's "Entry Team" was assigned to make Windows 3.0 generally
          appealing to the public, and was concerned that the public might
          perceive it as no more than a tool for large enterprises, due to high
          system requirements. Major game publishers did not see it as a
          potential game platform, instead sticking to MS-DOS. Microsoft's
          product manager Bruce Ryan compiled games that the Windows team had
          designed in its spare time to create Microsoft Entertainment Pack,
          which includes Tetris and Minesweeper. There was little budget, none
          spent on quality testing. Nevertheless, the Entertainment Pack was
          sold as a separate product, and it became so popular that it was
          followed by three other Entertainment Packs.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 31, 2001, Microsoft dropped support for Windows 3.0, along
          with previous versions of Windows and Windows 95, Windows for
          Workgroups, and MS-DOS versions up to 6.22.

        <p>
          Windows 3.0 was the only version of Windows that could be run in three
          different memory modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Real mode, intended for older computers with a CPU below Intel
            80286, and corresponding to its real mode;
          </li>
          <li>
            Standard mode, intended for computers with an 80286 processor, and
            corresponding to its protected mode;
          </li>
          <li>
            386 Enhanced mode, intended for newer computers with an Intel 80386
            processor or above, and corresponding to its protected mode and
            virtual 8086 mode.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Real mode primarily existed as a way to run Windows 2.x applications.
          It was removed in Windows 3.1. Almost all applications designed for
          Windows 3.0 had to be run in standard or 386 enhanced modes.
          (Microsoft Word 1.x and Excel 2.x would work in real mode as they were
          actually designed for Windows 2.x). However, it was necessary to load
          Windows 3.0 in real mode to run SWAPFILE.EXE, which allowed users to
          change virtual memory settings. Officially, Microsoft stated that an
          8Mhz turbo 8086 was the minimum CPU needed to run Windows 3.0. It
          could be run on 4.77 MHz 8088 machines, but performance was so slow as
          to render the OS almost unusable. Up to 4 MB of expanded memory (EMS)
          is supported in real mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard mode was used most often as its requirements were more
          in-line with an average PC of that era — an 80286 processor with at
          least 1 MB of memory. Since some PCs (notably Compaqs) did not place
          extended memory (XMS) at the 1MB line and instead left a hole between
          the end of conventional memory and the start of XMS, Windows could not
          work on them except in real mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          386 Enhanced mode was a 32-bit virtual machine that ran a copy of
          16-bit Standard mode, and multiple copies of MS-DOS in virtual 8086
          mode. 386 enhanced mode uses virtual 8086 mode to allow multiple DOS
          programs to run (each DOS session takes 1MB of memory) along with
          being windowed and allowing multitasking to continue. Virtual memory
          support allows the user to employ the hard disk as a temporary storage
          space if applications use more memory than exists in the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, Windows will start in the highest operating mode the
          computer can use, but the user may force it into lower modes by typing
          WIN /R or WIN /S at the DOS command prompt. If the user selects an
          operating mode that cannot be used due to lack of RAM or CPU support,
          Windows merely boots into the next lowest one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two updates known to have been published for Windows 3.0.
          One of them is Windows 3.0a, released in December 1990. It modified
          Windows' DOS extender—a program that enables DOS applications to
          access extended memory—to prevent errors caused by software calling
          into real-mode code when Windows is loaded in standard mode. It also
          simplified the installation process and alleviated crashes associated
          with networking, printing, and low-memory conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0 (MME) was released to
          third-party manufacturers in October 1991. The application programming
          interface introduced Media Control Interface, designed for any
          media-related device such as graphics and audio cards, scanners, and
          videotape players. It also supported recording and playing digital
          audio, MIDI devices, screensavers and analog joysticks, as well as
          CD-ROM drives, which were then becoming increasingly available. Other
          features included additional applets such as an alarm clock and Media
          Player, used to run media files. MME supports stereo sound and 16-bit
          audio bit depth and sampling rates of up to 44.1 kHz.

        <p>
          Windows 3.0 features a significantly revamped graphical user interface
          (GUI), which was described as having a three-dimensional look similar
          to the Presentation Manager, rather than the flat look of its
          predecessor, Windows 2.1. It also includes technical improvements to
          the memory management to make better use of the capabilities of
          Intel's 80286 and 80386 processors. Dynamic Data Exchange is a
          multitasking protocol whereby multiple running applications
          dynamically exchange data with one another, i.e., when data in one
          application changes, so does the data in another. This feature had
          appeared in Windows previously, but until Windows 3.0, due to memory
          constraints, users were unable to use the protocol. These users
          instead had to exit to DOS to run one application, close it, and open
          another to exchange data. Due to its support for the 386 and later
          processors, Windows 3.0 can also use virtual memory, which is a
          portion of a hard disk drive that is substituted for memory by the
          processor in the event that its own memory is exhausted. Like its
          predecessors, Windows 3.0 is not an operating system in its sense, but
          rather an operating environment that is designed for DOS and controls
          its functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The MS-DOS Executive file manager was replaced with Program Manager,
          the list-based File Manager, and Task List. Program Manager is a
          graphical shell composed of icons, each with an underlying title. They
          can be moved and arranged in any order, and the icons' titles can be
          renamed. When double-clicked on, these icons open corresponding
          applications or smaller windows within the Program Manager window
          called group windows. These group windows contain such icons and can
          be minimized to prevent cluttering of the Program Manager window's
          space. File Manager is another shell used to access or modify
          applications, but displays them as files contained in directories in a
          list format. Its purpose as an alternative to using DOS commands is to
          facilitate moving files and directories. Task List displays all
          running applications and may also be used to terminate them, select a
          different program, cascade or tile the windows, and arrange minimized
          desktop icons. The Control Panel, where users can change settings to
          customize Windows and hardware, was also redesigned as an icon-based
          window.
        </p>

        <p>
          The drivers bundled with Windows 3.0 support up to 16 simultaneous
          colors from EGA, MCGA or VGA palettes, as opposed to the previous
          maximum of eight colors, though the operating environment itself
          supports graphics adapters that offer resolutions and the number of
          colors greater than VGA. Windows 3.0 also introduced the Palette
          Manager, a set of functions that allow applications to change the
          lookup palette of graphics cards displaying up to 256 colors to use
          needed colors. When multiple displayed windows exceed the 256-color
          limit, Windows 3.0 prioritizes the active window to use that
          application's colors, without resorting to dithering and then filling
          in areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 3.0 retains many of the simple applications from its
          predecessors, such as the text editor Notepad, the word processor
          Write, and the improved paint program Paintbrush. Calculator is
          expanded to include scientific calculations. Recorder is a new program
          that records macros, or sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements,
          which are then assigned to keys as shortcuts to perform complex
          functions quickly. Also, the earlier Reversi game was complemented
          with the card game Microsoft Solitaire, which would eventually be
          inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2019. Another
          notable program is Help. Unlike DOS applications, which may have help
          functions as part of them, Windows Help is a separate and readily
          accessible application that accompanies all Windows programs that
          support it.

        <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
        <p>
          Windows 3.0 features a significantly revamped graphical user interface
          (GUI) that represents applications as clickable icons, instead of the
          list of file names in its predecessors. It was described as having a
          three-dimensional look similar to the Presentation Manager, rather
          than the flat look of its predecessor, Windows 2.1. Ted Needleman of
          the computer magazine Modern Electronics called Windows 3.0's GUI
          "state-of-the-art" and compared Microsoft's previous attempts to
          produce such a GUI to Apple Lisa, Apple's early such attempt and the
          predecessor to its far more successful Macintosh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The User Interface consisted of icons in the Program Manager, which
          replaced MS-DOS Executive for launching applications. As previously
          mentioned, the UI now had a "3D" feel, as compared to its predecessors
          with a flat feel. The icons had changed and were now more graphical,
          further refined, and easier to recognize. There were now upto a
          maximum of 16 colors that could be displayed simultaneously, as
          opposed to the maximum of 8 colors on its predecessors. The OS also
          introduced the Palette Manager, a set of functions that allowed
          applications to change the lookup palette of GPUs, supporting upto 256
          colors to use required colors. The desktop was a graphical
          representation of the user's workspace. It feature a background which
          could now be changed to a pattern or bitmap image, icons that acted as
          shortcuts (similar to shortcuts on modern operating system desktops),
          and at the bottom of the screen a bunch of icons next to each other
          that represented minimized programs (similar to today's Windows
          taskbar or macOS's dock). The toolbars were updated. For example, the
          File Manager's toolbar now had buttons for common tasks like copying,
          cutting and pasting files.
