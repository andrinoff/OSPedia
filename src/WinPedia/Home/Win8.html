      <p>
        Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform
        and user interface with the intention to improve its user experience on
        tablets, where Windows was competing with mobile operating systems such
        as Android and iOS. These changes included a Windows shell and GUI
        optimised for touchscreeen devices, along with a start screen based on
        Microsoft's new Metro design language, integration with online services,
        the Windows Store, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Many of
        these features were adapted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 also added
        support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format, near-field communication, and
        cloud computing, as well as a new lock screen with clock and
        notifications. Additional security features—including built-in antivirus
        software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering, and
        support for Secure Boot on supported devices—were introduced. It was the
        first Windows version to support ARM architecture under the Windows RT
        branding. CPUs without PAE, SSE2 and NX are unsupported in this version.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 8 received a mostly negative reception. Although the reaction to
        its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved
        support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface was
        widely criticized as confusing and unintuitive, especially when used
        with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen. Even then, 60
        million licenses were sold through January 2013, including upgrades and
        sales to OEMs for new PCs.

          Development started in 2009 while Microsoft was finishing work on
          Windows 7. In January 2011, it was announced at the Consumer
          Electronics Show that Windows 8 would add support for ARM
          System-on-Chips alongside the existing 32-bit processors produced by
          vendors, especially AMD and Intel. Windows division president Steven
          Sinofsky demonstrated an early build of the OS on prototype devices,
          while Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the company's goal for
          Windows to be "everywhere on every kind of device without compromise."
          Details also began to surface about a new application framework for
          Windows 8 codenamed "Jupiter", which would be used to make "immersive"
          applications using XAML (similarly to Windows Phone and Silverlight)
          that could be distributed through a new packaging system and a rumored
          application store.
        </p>

        <p>
          The earliest available build of Windows 8 is build 7700, which was
          compiled in January 2010. It was almost identical to Windows 7 except
          for the wallpaper being different—the same one from the Beta and
          Release Candidate. In addition, there were a few references to Windows
          8 in this build's Local Group Policy Editor Utility. Two milestone
          releases of Windows 8 (builds 7850 and 7955) and one milestone release
          of Windows Server 2012 (build 7959) was leaked to the general public.
          <b>Milestone 1, Build 7850</b>, was built on September 22, 2010 and
          leaked on April 12, 2011. The leaked copy was Enterprise edition, and
          other editions leaked later. It was discovered that Metro existed in
          this build, in 2020, after disabling the Redpill feature lockout. The
          start screen was primitive, a screen with a white background and gray
          tiles. The charms bar was included, but was unusable. The OS still
          reads "Windows 7". <b>Milestone 2, Build 7955</b>, was leaked on April
          25, 2011. The traditional Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) was replaced by
          a new black screen, but was later reverted to a different blue color.
          This build introduced a new ribbon in Windows Explorer. The "Windows
          7" logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying "Microsoft
          Confidential". Both builds 7850 and 7955 leaked alongside Windows
          Server 2012 build 7959. On June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition
          was leaked. It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same Betta
          fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was later
          replaced, and the circling dots as featured in the final build
          (although the final version comes with smaller circling dots). It also
          had the text Welcome below them, which was scrapped.

        <p>
          New features and functionality in Windows 8 include a faster startup
          through UEFI integration and the new "Hybrid Boot" mode (which
          hibernates the Windows kernel on shutdown to speed up the subsequent
          boot), a new lock screen with a clock and notifications, and the
          ability for enterprise users to create live USB variants of Windows
          (also known as Windows To Go). It also includes native support for USB
          3 devices, which allow for faster data transfers and improved power
          management with compatible devices, and hard disk 4KB Advanced Format
          support, as well as support for near field communication to facilitate
          sharing and communication between devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows Explorer, which has been renamed to File Explorer, now
          includes a ribbon in place of the command bar. File operation dialog
          boxes have been updated to provide more detailed statistics, the
          ability to pause file transfers, and improvements in the ability to
          manage conflicts when copying files. A new "File History" function
          allows incremental revisions of files to be backed up to and restored
          from a secondary storage device, while Storage Spaces allows users to
          combine different sized hard disks into virtual drives and specify
          mirroring, parity, or no redundancy on a folder-by-folder basis. For
          easier management of files and folders, Windows 8 introduces the
          ability to move selected files or folders via drag and drop from a
          parent folder into a subfolder listed within the breadcrumb hierarchy
          of the address bar in File Explorer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Task Manager has been redesigned, including a new processes tab with
          the option to display fewer or more details of running applications
          and background processes, a heat map using different colors indicating
          the level of resource usage, network and disk counters, grouping by
          process type (e.g. applications, background processes and Windows
          processes), friendly names for processes and a new option which allows
          users to search the web to find information about obscure processes.
          Additionally, the Blue Screen of Death has been updated with a simpler
          and modern design with less technical information displayed.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Safety and security</summary>
          <p>
            New security features in Windows 8 include two new authentication
            methods tailored towards touchscreens (PINs and picture passwords),
            the addition of antivirus capabilities to Windows Defender (bringing
            it in parity with Microsoft Security Essentials). SmartScreen
            filtering integrated into Windows, Family Safety offers parental
            controls, which allows parents to monitor and manage their
            children's activities on a device with activity reports and safety
            controls. Windows 8 also provides integrated system recovery through
            the new "Refresh" and "Reset" functions, including system recovery
            from USB drive. Windows 8's first security patches would be released
            on November 13, 2012; it would contain three fixes deemed "critical"
            by the company.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 8 supports a feature of the UEFI specification known as
            "Secure boot", which uses a public-key infrastructure to verify the
            integrity of the operating system and prevent unauthorized programs
            such as bootkits from infecting the device's boot process. Some
            pre-built devices may be described as "certified" by Microsoft;
            these must have secure boot enabled by default, and provide ways for
            users to disable or re-configure the feature. ARM-based Windows RT
            devices must have secure boot permanently enabled.
          </p>

          <summary class="level-two">Online services and functionality</summary>
          <p>
            Windows 8 provides tighter integration with online services from
            Microsoft and others. A user can now log into Windows with a
            Microsoft account, which can be used to access services and
            synchronize applications and settings between multiple devices. A
            client app for Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud storage service allows
            apps to save files directly to SkyDrive. However, a SkyDrive client
            for the desktop and File Explorer is not included in Windows 8, and
            must be downloaded separately. Bundled multimedia apps are provided
            under the Xbox brand, including Xbox Music, Xbox Video, and the Xbox
            SmartGlass companion for use with an Xbox 360 console. Games can
            integrate into an Xbox Live hub app, which also allows users to view
            their profile and Gamerscore. Other bundled apps provide the ability
            to link Flickr and Facebook. Due to Facebook Connect service
            changes, Facebook support is disabled in all bundled apps effective
            June 8, 2015.
          </p>

          <p>
            Internet Explorer 10 is included as two variants – a desktop program
            and a touch-optimized app. It also includes increased support for
            HTML5, CSS3, and hardware acceleration. The app does not support
            plugins or ActiveX components, but includes a variant of Adobe Flash
            Player that is optimized for touch and low-power usage. Initially,
            Adobe Flash would only work on sites included on a "Compatibility
            View" whitelist; however, after feedback from users and additional
            compatibility tests, an update in March 2013 changed this behavior
            to use a smaller blacklist of sites with known compatibility issues
            instead, allowing Flash to be used with most sites by default. The
            desktop variant does not contain these limitations.v
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 8 also incorporates improved support for mobile broadband;
            the operating system can now detect the insertion of a SIM card and
            automatically configure connection settings (including APNs and
            carrier branding), and reduce its Internet usage to conserve
            bandwidth on metered networks. An integrated airplane mode setting
            enables users to globally disable all wireless connectivity.
            Carriers can also offer account management systems through Windows
            Store apps, which can be automatically installed as a part of the
            connection process and offer usage statistics on their respective
            tile.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Windows Store apps</summary>
          <p>
            Windows 8 introduces a new style of application, Windows Store apps.
            According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris, these apps are
            optimized for touchscreen environments and are more specialized than
            current desktop applications. Apps can run either in a full-screen
            mode or be snapped to the side of a screen. Apps can provide toast
            notifications on screen or animate their tiles on the Start screen
            with dynamic content. Apps can use "contracts"; a collection of
            hooks to provide common functionality that can integrate with other
            apps, including search and sharing. Apps can also provide
            integration with other services; for example, the People app can
            connect to a variety of different social networks and services (such
            as Facebook, Skype, and People service), while the Photos app can
            aggregate photos from services such as Facebook and Flickr.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows Store apps run within a new set of APIs known as Windows
            Runtime, which supports programming languages such as C, C++, Visual
            Basic .NET, C#, along with HTML5 and JavaScript. If written in some
            "high-level" languages, apps written for Windows Runtime can be
            compatible with both Intel and ARM variants of Windows, otherwise
            they are not binary code compatible. Components may be compiled as
            Windows Runtime Components, permitting their use by all compatible
            languages. To ensure stability and security, apps run within a
            sandboxed environment, and require permissions to use certain other
            functionalities, such as accessing the Internet or a camera.
          </p>

          <p>
            Retail variants of Windows 8 are only able to install these apps
            through Windows Store – a namesake distribution platform that offers
            both apps, and listings for desktop programs certified for
            comparability with Windows 8. A method to sideload apps from outside
            Windows Store is available to devices running Windows 8 Enterprise
            and joined to a domain; Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT devices that
            are not part of a domain can also sideload apps, but only after
            special product keys are obtained through volume licensing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "Immersive app" had been used internally by Microsoft
            developers to refer to the apps prior to the first official
            presentation of Windows 8, after which they were referred to as
            "Metro-style apps" in reference to the Metro design language. The
            term was phased out in August 2012; a Microsoft spokesperson denied
            rumors that the change was related to a potential trademark issue,
            and stated that "Metro" was only a codename that would be replaced
            prior to Windows 8's release. Following these reports, the terms
            "Modern UI-style apps", "Windows 8-style apps", and "Windows Store
            apps" began to be used in various Microsoft documents and material
            to refer to the new apps. In an interview on September 12, 2012,
            Soma Somasegar (vice president of Microsoft's development software
            division) confirmed that "Windows Store apps" would be the official
            term for the apps. An MSDN page explaining the Metro design language
            uses the term "Modern design" to refer to the language as a whole.

          <summary class="level-two">Web browsers</summary>

          <p>
            Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given
            to web browsers. The user's default browser can distribute a
            Metro-style web browser in the same package as the desktop variant,
            which has access to functionality unavailable to other apps, such as
            being able to permanently run in the background, use multiple
            background processes, and use Windows API code instead of WinRT
            (allowing for code to be re-used with the desktop variant, while
            still taking advantage of features available to Windows Store apps,
            such as charms). Microsoft advertises this exception privilege "New
            experience enabled" (formerly "Metro-style enabled").
          </p>

          <p>
            The developers of both Chrome and Firefox committed to developing
            Metro-style variants of their browsers; while Chrome's "Windows 8
            mode" (discontinued on Chrome version 49) uses a full-screen version
            of the existing desktop interface, Firefox's variant (which was
            first made available on the "Aurora" release channel in September
            2013) uses a touch-optimized interface inspired by the Android
            variant of Firefox. In October 2013, Chrome's app was changed to
            mimic the desktop environment used by ChromeOS. Development of the
            Firefox app for Windows 8 has since been cancelled, citing a lack of
            user adoption of the beta versions.

          <summary class="level-two">Removed features</summary>
          <p>
            Several notable features were removed in Windows 8; support for
            playing DVD-Video was removed from Windows Media Player due to the
            cost of licensing the necessary decoders (especially for devices
            which do not include optical disc drives at all) and the prevalence
            of online streaming services. For the same reasons, Windows Media
            Center is not included by default on Windows 8, but Windows Media
            Center and DVD playback support could be purchased in the "Pro Pack"
            (which upgrades the system to Windows 8 Pro) or the "Media Center
            Pack" add-on for Windows 8 Pro. As with prior versions, third-party
            DVD player software can still be used to enable DVD playback.
          </p>

          <p>
            Backup and Restore, the backup component of Windows, was deprecated.
            It still shipped with Windows 8 and continues to work on preset
            schedules, but it was pushed to the background and can only be
            accessed through a Control Panel applet called "Windows 7 File
            Recovery".  Shadow Copy, a component of Windows Explorer that once
            saved previous versions of changed files, no longer protects local
            files and folders. It can only access previous versions of shared
            files stored on a Windows Server computer.  The subsystem on which
            these components worked, however, is still available for other
            software to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            Support for older XPDM and VGA display adapter drivers was removed
            in favor of heightened kernel stability, GPU scheduling performance
            and security.

          Windows 8 is available in three different editions, of which only the
          base edition, branded simply as Windows 8, and Windows 8 Pro, were
          sold at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new
          computers. Each edition of Windows 8 includes all of the capabilities
          and features of the edition preceding it, and add additional features
          oriented towards their market segments. Windows 8 was distributed as a
          retail box product on DVD, and through a digital download that could
          be converted into DVD or USB install media. From its launch until
          January 31, 2013, as part of a launch promotion, Microsoft offered
          Windows 8 Pro upgrades at a discounted price of US$39.99 online, or
          $69.99 for a retail box; afterward the Windows 8 price has been
          $119.99 and the Pro price $199.99. Those who purchased new PCs
          pre-loaded with Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, or
          Ultimate between June 2, 2012, and January 31, 2013, could digitally
          purchase a Windows 8 Pro upgrade for US$14.99. Several PC
          manufacturers offered rebates and refunds on Windows 8 upgrades
          obtained through promotions on select models, such as those of
          Hewlett-Packard (in the U.S. and Canada on select models) and Acer (in
          Europe on selected Ultrabook models). During these promotions, the
          Windows Media Center add-on for Windows 8 Pro was also offered for
          free. Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows 8 was distributed
          at retail only under "Upgrade" licenses, which require a previous
          version of Windows to install. The "full version software" SKU, which
          was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an
          eligible OS or none at all, was discontinued. In lieu of a full
          version, a specialized "System Builder" SKU was introduced. The
          "System Builder" replaced the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
          SKU, which was only allowed for use on PCs meant for resale but added
          a "Personal Use License" exemption that officially allowed its
          purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers. Retail
          distribution of Windows 8 has since been discontinued in favor of
          Windows 8.1. Unlike Windows 8, 8.1 is available as "full version
          software" as both a packaged DVD and online for download, and does not
          require a previous version of Windows in order to be installed.
          Pricing for these new copies remains identical with that of Windows 8.
          With the retail release of Windows 8.1 returning to being full version
          software, the "Personal Use License" exemption was removed from the
          OEM SKU, meaning that end users building their own PCs for personal
          use must use the full retail variant in order to satisfy the Windows
          8.1 licensing requirements.

        <p>
          Windows 8 introduces significant changes to the operating system's
          user interface, many of which are aimed at improving its experience on
          tablet computers and other touchscreen devices. The new user interface
          is based on Microsoft's Metro design language and uses a Start screen
          similar to that of Windows Phone 7 as the primary means of launching
          applications. The Start screen displays a customizable array of tiles
          linking to various apps and desktop programs, some of which can
          display constantly updated information and content through "live
          tiles". As a form of multi-tasking, apps can be snapped to the side of
          a screen. Alongside the traditional Control Panel, a new simplified
          and touch-optimized settings app known as "PC Settings" is used for
          basic configuration and user settings. It does not include many of the
          advanced options still accessible from the Control Panel.

          A vertical toolbar known as the charms (accessed by swiping from the
          right edge of a touchscreen, swiping from the right edge of a
          touchpad, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a
          screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as
          search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button. The
          traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is
          accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the
          taskbar from previous versions of Windows has been converted into a
          hotspot (or "hot corner") in the lower-left corner of the screen,
          which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the Start
          screen. Windows 8.1 added the start button back to the taskbar after
          many complaints, but removed the preview thumbnail. Swiping from the
          left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the
          screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the
          cursor at the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a
          thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the Start
          button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and
          solid-colored design (Metro-style UI), the desktop interface on
          Windows 8 is similar to that of Windows 7.

            Find the start button in this screenshot. Oh wait, you can't because
            they removed it. Well the start menu? Nope, you got a start
            <i>screen</i>. This version of Windows was developed with tablets in
            mind.
