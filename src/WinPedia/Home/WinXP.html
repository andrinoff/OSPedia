        Windows XP is a major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating
        systems. It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and later
        to retail on October 25, 2001. It is a direct successor to Windows 2000
        for high-end and business users and Windows Me for home users.

      </div>

      <p>
        Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s under the codename
        "Neptune", built on the Windows NT kernel and explicitly intended for
        mainstream consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000, codenamed
        "<abbr
          title="Windows Odyssey was a version of Windows that never left the planning stage"
          >Odyssey</abbr
        >", was also initially planned for the business market. However, in
        January 2000, both Windows Odyssey and Neptune were scrapped and
        replaced by a single unified operating system codenamed "Whistler" based
        on the Windows NT kernel, which would serve both home consumers and
        buisness markets. Thsi occured as they realized that both were going to
        based on the same Windows 2000 codebase. Therefore, Windows XP is the
        first consumer edition of Windows which is not based on the Windows 95
        kernel or MS-DOS. Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486, and SGI
        Visual Workstation 320 and 540 architecture, and only runs on 32-bit x86
        CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased
        performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a new,
        visually appealing user interface, improved hardware support, and
        expanded multimedia capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
        were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in
        2007 and 2008, respectively. Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on
        April 14, 2009, and extended support ended on April 8, 2014. Windows
        Embedded POSReady 2009, based on Windows XP Professional, received
        security updates until April 2019. The final security update for Service
        Pack 3 was released on May 14, 2019. Unofficial methods were made
        available to apply the updates to other editions of Windows XP, which
        Microsoft has discouraged, citing compatibility issues.
      </p>

        <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
        <p>
          In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP
          was focused on two individual products: "Odyssey", which was
          reportedly intended to succeed the future Windows 2000 and "Neptune",
          which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the
          Windows NT architecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the projects proved to be too ambitious. In January 2000,
          shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology
          writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune
          and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed "Whistler", named
          after Whistler, British Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at
          the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort. The goal of Whistler was to unify
          both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single,
          Windows NT platform. Thurrott stated that Neptune had become "a black
          hole when all the features that were cut from Windows Me were simply
          re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be
          based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into
          a single project".
        </p>
        <p>
          At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be
          released during the second half of 2001, and also unveiled the first
          preview build, 2250, which featured an early implementation of Windows
          XP's visual styles system and interface changes to Windows Explorer
          and the Control Panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft released the first public beta build of Whistler, build
          2296, on October 31, 2000. Subsequent builds gradually introduced
          features that users of the release version of Windows XP would
          recognize, such as Internet Explorer 6.0, the Microsoft Product
          Activation system, and the Bliss desktop background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whistler was officially unveiled during a media event on February 5,
          2001, under the name Windows XP, where XP stands for "eXPerience".
        </p>
        <p>
          In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to spend at
          least US$1 billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP, in
          conjunction with Intel and other PC makers. The theme of the campaign,
          "Yes You Can", was designed to emphasize the platform's overall
          capabilities. Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan
          "Prepare to Fly", but it was replaced because of sensitivity issues in
          the wake of the September 11 attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to
          manufacturing (RTM). During a ceremonial media event at Microsoft
          Redmond Campus, copies of the RTM build were given to representatives
          of several major PC manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on
          decorated helicopters. While PC manufacturers would be able to release
          devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to
          reach general retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same
          day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two
          main editions, "Home" (as a replacement for Windows Me for home
          computing) and "Professional" (as a replacement for Windows 2000 for
          high-end users).
        </p>

        <span class="level-two">Service packs</span>
        <p>
          A service pack is a cumulative update package that is a superset of
          all updates, and even service packs, that have been released before
          it. Three service packs have been released for Windows XP. Service
          Pack 3 is slightly different, as it needs at least Service Pack 1 to
          have been installed, in order to update a live OS. However, Service
          Pack 3 can still be embedded into a Windows installation disc where
          SP1 is not reported as a prerequisite for doing so.
        </p>

        <p>
          The boot screens for all editions of Windows XP have been unified by
          Service Pack 2 for Windows XP with a new one that no longer displays
          the SKU, with the boot screen for Home Edition using a blue progress
          bar instead of green. The copyright years on the boot screen were also
          removed.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-three">Service Pack 1</summary>
          <p>
            Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9,
            2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with
            all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1
            also added USB 2.0 support, the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, .NET
            Framework support, and support for technologies used by the
            then-upcoming Media Center and Tablet PC editions of XP. The most
            significant change on SP1 was the addition of Set Program Access and
            Defaults, a settings page which allows programs to be set as default
            for certain types of activities (such as media players or web
            browsers) and for access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as
            Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player) to be disabled. This
            feature was added to comply with the settlement of United States v.
            Microsoft Corp., which required Microsoft to offer the ability for
            OEMs to bundle third-party competitors to software it bundles with
            Windows (such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player), and
            give them the same level of prominence as those normally bundled
            with the OS.
          </p>

          <p>
            On February 3, 2003, Microsoft released Service Pack 1a (SP1a). It
            was the same as SP1, except the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine was
            excluded.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-three">Service Pack 2</summary>
          <p>
            Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Windows XP Home edition and Professional
            edition was released on August 25, 2004. Headline features included
            WPA encryption compatibility for Wi-Fi and usability improvements to
            the Wi-Fi networking user interface, partial Bluetooth support, and
            various improvements to security systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Headed by former computer hacker Window Snyder, the service pack's
            security improvements (codenamed "Springboard", as these features
            were intended to underpin additional changes in Longhorn) included a
            major revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall,
            and now enabled by default), and an update to Data Execution
            Prevention, which gained hardware support in the NX bit that can
            stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks. Raw socket support is
            removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by zombie machines)
            and the Windows Messenger service (which had been abused to cause
            pop-up advertisements to be displayed as system messages without a
            web browser or any additional software) became disabled by default.
            Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and
            web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added Security Center, an
            interface that provides a general overview of the system's security
            status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates.
            Third-party firewall and antivirus software can also be monitored
            from Security Center.
          </p>

          <p>
            In August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for
            Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (SP2b), in order to
            incorporate a patch requiring ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer
            to be manually activated before a user may interact with them. This
            was done so that the browser would not violate a patent owned by
            Eolas. Microsoft has since licensed the patent, and released a patch
            reverting the change in April 2008. In September 2007, another minor
            revision known as SP2c was released for XP Professional, extending
            the number of available product keys for the operating system to
            "support the continued availability of Windows XP Professional
            through the scheduled system builder channel end-of-life (EOL) date
            of January 31, 2009."

        <details>
          <summary class="level-three">Service Pack 3</summary>
          <p>
            The third and final Service Pack, SP3, was released through
            different channels between April 21 and June 10, 2008, about a year
            after the release of Windows Vista, and about a year before the
            release of Windows 7. Service Pack 3 was not available for Windows
            XP x64 Edition, which was based on the Windows Server 2003 kernel
            and, as a result, used its service packs rather than the ones for
            the other editions.
          </p>

          <p>
            It began being automatically pushed out to Automatic Updates users
            on July 10, 2008. A feature set overview which detailed new features
            available separately as stand-alone updates to Windows XP, as well
            as backported features from Windows Vista, was posted by Microsoft.
            A total of 1,174 fixes are included in SP3. Service Pack 3 could be
            installed on systems with Internet Explorer up to and including
            version 8; Internet Explorer 7 was not included as part of SP3. It
            also did not include Internet Explorer 8, but instead was included
            in Windows 7, which was released one year after XP SP3.
          </p>

          <p>
            Service Pack 3 included security enhancements over and above those
            of SP2, including APIs allowing developers to enable Data Execution
            Prevention for their code, independent of system-wide compatibility
            enforcement settings, the Security Support Provider Interface,
            improvements to WPA2 security, and an updated version of the
            Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Module that is FIPS 140-2
            certified.
          </p>

          <p>
            In incorporating all previously released updates not included in
            SP2, Service Pack 3 included many other key features. Windows
            Imaging Component allowed camera vendors to integrate their own
            proprietary image codecs with the operating system's features, such
            as thumbnails and slideshows. In enterprise features, Remote Desktop
            Protocol 6.1 included support for ClearType and 32-bit color depth
            over RDP, while improvements made to Windows Management
            Instrumentation in Windows Vista to reduce the possibility of
            corruption of the WMI repository were backported to XP SP3.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, SP3 contains updates to the operating system components
            of Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) and Windows XP Tablet PC
            Edition, and security updates for .NET Framework version 1.0, which
            is included in these editions. However, it does not include update
            rollups for the Windows Media Center application in Windows XP MCE
            2005. SP3 also omits security updates for Windows Media Player 10,
            although the player is included in Windows XP MCE 2005.

        <p>
          Windows XP introduced multitudes of new features, but also removed a
          few. These include the changes to the user interface, infrastructure,
          networking and internet functionality and backward compatibility, not
          to mention other features.

          <p>
            Windows XP uses prefetching to improve startup and application
            launch times. It also became possible to revert the installation of
            an updated device driver, should the updated driver produce
            undesirable results.
          </p>

          <p>
            A copy protection system known as Windows Product Activation was
            introduced with Windows XP and its server counterpart, Windows
            Server 2003. All non-enterprise (Volume Licensing) Windows licenses
            must be tied to a unique ID generated using information from the
            computer hardware, transmitted either via the internet or a
            telephone hotline. If Windows is not activated within 30 days of
            installation, the OS will cease to function until it is activated.
            Windows also periodically verifies the hardware to check for
            changes. If significant hardware changes are detected, the
            activation is voided, and Windows must be re-activated.

            Windows XP was originally bundled with Internet Explorer 6, Outlook
            Express 6, Windows Messenger, and MSN Explorer. New networking
            features were also added, including Internet Connection Firewall,
            Internet Connection Sharing integration with UPnP, NAT traversal
            APIs, Quality of Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling,
            Background Intelligent Transfer Service, extended fax features,

            modems, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connections with auto configuration and
            roaming, TAPI 3.1, and networking over FireWire. Remote Assistance
            and Remote Desktop were also added, which allow users to connect to
            a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the Internet
            and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or
            request help. Improvements were also made to IntelliMirror features

          <p>
            To enable running software that targets or locks out specific
            versions of Windows, "Compatibility mode" was added. It allows
            pretending a selected earlier version of Windows to software,
            starting at Windows 95. This feature was first introduced in Windows
            2000 Service Pack 2, released five months before the release of
            Windows XP, and was backported from prerelease Windows XP builds.
            Unlike with Windows XP, however, it was hidden from the operating
            system as it was not enabled by default and had to be manually
            activated through the Register Server utility. It was also only
            available to administrator users. Windows XP has this feature
            activated out of the box and also grants it to regular users.

            Some of the programs and features that were part of the previous
            versions of Windows did not make it to Windows XP. Various MS-DOS
            commands available in its Windows 9x predecessor were removed, as
            were the POSIX and OS/2 subsystems.

            In networking, NetBEUI, NWLink and NetDDE were deprecated and not
            installed by default. Plug-and-play–incompatible communication
            devices (like modems and network interface cards) were no longer
            supported.
          </p>
          <p>
            Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3 also removed features from Windows
            XP, including support for TCP half-open connections and the address
            bar on the taskbar.

        <p>
          Windows XP was released in two major editions on launch: Home Edition
          and Professional Edition. Both editions were made available at retail
          as pre-loaded software on new computers and as boxed copies. Boxed
          copies were sold as "Upgrade" or "Full" licenses; the "Upgrade"
          versions were slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of
          Windows to install. The "Full" version can be installed on systems
          without an operating system or existing version of Windows. The two
          editions of XP were aimed at different markets: Home Edition is
          explicitly intended for consumer use and disables or removes certain
          advanced and enterprise-oriented features present on Professional,
          such as the ability to join a Windows domain, Internet Information
          Services, and Multilingual User Interface. Windows 98 or Me can be
          upgraded to either edition, but Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 can
          only be upgraded to Professional. Windows' software license agreement
          for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be "returned" to the
          OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it. Despite the
          refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been
          enforced by courts in some countries.

          Two specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain
          types of hardware, exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded
          software. Windows XP Media Center Edition was initially designed for
          high-end home theater PCs with TV tuners (marketed under the term
          "Media Center PC"), offering expanded multimedia functionality, an
          electronic program guide, and digital video recorder (DVR) support
          through the Windows Media Center application. Microsoft also unveiled
          Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, which contains additional pen input
          features, and is optimized for mobile devices meeting its Tablet PC
          specifications. Two different 64-bit editions of XP were made
          available. The first, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, was intended for
          IA-64 (Itanium) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on workstations in
          favor of AMD's x86-64 architecture, the Itanium edition was
          discontinued in January 2005. A new 64-bit edition supporting the
          x86-64 architecture, called Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, was
          released in April 2005.
        </p>

          Microsoft also targeted emerging markets with the 2004 introduction of
          Windows XP Starter Edition, a special variant of Home Edition intended
          for low-cost PCs. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer
          owners, containing heavy localization (including wallpapers and screen
          savers incorporating images of local landmarks), and a "My Support"
          area which contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also
          removes certain "complex" features, and does not allow users to run
          more than three applications at a time. After a pilot program in India
          and Thailand, Starter was released in other emerging markets
          throughout 2005. In 2006, Microsoft also unveiled the FlexGo
          initiative, which would also target emerging markets with subsidized
          PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.

          As a result of unfair competition lawsuits in Europe and South Korea,
          which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status
          in the PC market to favor its own bundled software, Microsoft was
          ordered to release special editions of XP in these markets that
          excluded certain applications. In March 2004, after the European
          Commission fined Microsoft €497 million (US$603 million), Microsoft
          was ordered to release "N" editions of XP that excluded Windows Media
          Player, encouraging users to pick and download their own media player
          software. As it was sold at the same price as the edition with Windows
          Media Player included, certain OEMs (such as Dell, who offered it for
          a short period, along with Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Fujitsu
          Siemens) chose not to offer it. Consumer interest was minuscule, with
          roughly 1,500 units shipped to OEMs, and no reported sales to
          consumers. In December 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission ordered
          Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and Windows Server
          2003 that do not contain Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger.
          The "K" and "KN" editions of Windows XP were released in August 2006,
          and are only available in English and Korean, and also contain links
          to third-party instant messenger and media player software.

          While retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP's
          interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an
          increased use of alpha compositing effects, drop shadows, and "visual
          styles", which completely changed the appearance of the operating
          system. The number of effects enabled are determined by the operating
          system based on the computer's processing power, and can be enabled or
          disabled on a case-by-case basis. XP also added ClearType, a new
          subpixel rendering system designed to improve the appearance of fonts
          on liquid-crystal displays. A new set of system icons was also
          introduced. The default wallpaper, Bliss, is a photo of a landscape in
          the Napa Valley outside Napa, California, with rolling green hills and
          a blue sky with stratocumulus and cirrus clouds.
        </p>

          The Start menu received its first major overhaul in XP, switching to a
          two-column layout with the ability to list, pin, and display
          frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and the
          traditional cascading "All Programs" menu. The taskbar can now group
          windows opened by a single application into one taskbar button, with a
          popup menu listing the individual windows. The notification area also
          hides "inactive" icons by default. A "common tasks" list was added,
          and Windows Explorer's sidebar was updated to use a new task-based
          design with lists of common actions; the tasks displayed are
          contextually relevant to the type of content in a folder (e.g. a
          folder with music displays offers to play all the files in the folder,
          or burn them to a CD).
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP
          machine without existing users having to close their programs and log
          out. Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e.,
          monitor, keyboard, and mouse), previous users can resume their session
          once they regain control of the computer. Service Pack 2 and Service
          Pack 3 also introduced new features to Windows XP post-release,
          including the Windows Security Center, Bluetooth support, Data
          Execution Prevention, Windows Firewall, and support for SDHC cards
          that are larger than 4 GB and smaller than 32 GB.
