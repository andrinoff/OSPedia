        Windows 10 is a major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system
        as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released to manufacturing on
        July 15, 2015, and later to retail on July 29, 2015. Windows 10 was made
        available for download via MSDN and TechNet, as a free upgrade for
        retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users via the Microsoft
        Store, and to Windows 7 users via Windows Update. Unlike previous
        Windows NT releases, Windows 10 receives new builds on an ongoing basis,
        which are available at no additional cost to users; devices in
        enterprise environments can alternatively use long-term support
        milestones that only receive critical updates, such as security patches.

        Unlike the tablet-oriented approach of Windows 8, Microsoft provided the
        desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows in
        Windows 10. Other features added include Xbox Live integration, the
        virtual assistant Cortana, virtual desktops and the improved Settings
        component. Windows 10 also replaced Internet Explorer with Microsoft
        Edge. Like previous versions, Windows 10 has been developed primarily
        for x86 processors; although a version of Windows 10 for ARM processors
        was released in 2018. Windows 10 received generally positive reviews
        upon its original release, and praise was given to the return of the
        desktop interface, improved bundled software compared to Windows 8.1,
        and other capabilities. However, media outlets were critical of
        behavioral changes of the system such as mandatory update installation,
        privacy concerns over data collection and the adware-like tactics used
        to promote the operating system on its release. Microsoft initially
        aimed to have Windows 10 installed on over one billion devices within
        three years of its release, but this goal was ultimately reached almost
        five years after release on March 16, 2020, and it surpassed Windows 7
        as the most popular version of Windows worldwide by January 2018, which
        remains to be the case in 2024. Windows 10 is the most-used traditional
        PC operating system, with a 46% share of users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 10 is the last version of Microsoft Windows that supports 32-bit
        processors (IA-32 and ARMv7-based), the last non-IoT edition to
        officially lack a CPU whitelist and support BIOS firmware, and the last
        version to officially support systems with TPM 1.2 or without any TPM at
        all. Support for Windows 10 editions which are not in the Long-Term
        Servicing Channel (LTSC) is set to end on October 14, 2025.

          At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in 2011, Andrew Lees,
          the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company
          intended to have a single software ecosystem for PCs, smartphones,
          tablets, and other devices: "We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and
          one for phones, and one for tablets‍—‌they'll all come together."
        </p>

          In December 2013, technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that
          Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed "Threshold",
          after a planet in its Halo franchise. Similarly to "Blue" (which
          became Windows 8.1), Foley described Threshold, not as a single
          operating system, but as a "wave of operating systems" across multiple
          Microsoft platforms and services, quoting Microsoft sources, scheduled
          for the second quarter of 2015. She also stated that one of the goals
          for Threshold was to create a unified application platform and
          development toolkit for Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox One (which all
          use a similar kernel based on Windows NT).
        </p>

        <p>
          At the Build Conference in April 2014, Microsoft's Terry Myerson
          unveiled an early build of what would become Windows 10 (build 9697)
          that added the ability to run Microsoft Store apps inside desktop
          windows and a more traditional Start menu modeled after Windows 7's
          design by using only a portion of the screen and including an
          application listing in the left column, with the right column
          displaying Windows 8-style app tiles. Myerson said that these changes
          would occur in a future update, but did not elaborate. Microsoft also
          unveiled the concept of a "universal Windows app", allowing Windows
          Store apps created for Windows 8.1 to be ported to Windows Phone 8.1
          and Xbox One while sharing a common codebase, with an interface
          designed for different device form factors, and allowing user data and
          licenses for an app to be shared between multiple platforms. Windows
          Phone 8.1 would share nearly 90% of the common Windows Runtime APIs
          with Windows 8.1 on PCs.
        </p>

        <p>
          A screenshot of a build identifying itself as "Windows Technical
          Preview" (numbered 9834) was leaked in September 2014, showing a new
          virtual desktop system, a notification center, and a new File Explorer
          icon.

          <p>
            On September 30, 2014, Microsoft officially announced that Threshold
            would be unveiled during a media event as Windows 10. Myerson said
            that Windows 10 would be Microsoft's "most comprehensive platform
            ever", providing a single, unified platform for desktop and laptop
            computers, tablets, smartphones, and all-in-one devices. He
            emphasized that Windows 10 would take steps towards restoring user
            interface mechanics from Windows 7 to improve the experience for
            users on non-touch devices, noting criticism of Windows 8's
            touch-oriented interface by keyboard and mouse users. Despite these
            concessions, Myerson noted that the touch-optimized interface would
            evolve as well on Windows 10.
          </p>

          <p>
            In regards to Microsoft naming the new operating system Windows 10
            instead of Windows 9, Terry Myerson said that "based on the product
            that's coming, and just how different our approach will be overall,
            it wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9." He also joked that they
            could not call it "Windows One" (referring to several recent
            Microsoft products with a similar brand, such as OneDrive, OneNote,
            and the Xbox One) because Windows 1.0 already existed. At a San
            Francisco conference in October 2014, Tony Prophet, Microsoft's Vice
            President of Windows Marketing, said that Windows 9 "came and went",
            and that Windows 10 would not be "an incremental step from Windows
            8.1", but "a material step. We're trying to create one platform, one
            eco-system that unites as many of the devices from the small
            embedded Internet of Things, through tablets, through phones,
            through PCs and, ultimately, into the Xbox."
          </p>

          <p>
            Further details surrounding Windows 10's consumer-oriented features
            were presented during another media event held on January 21, 2015,
            titled "Windows 10: The Next Chapter". The keynote featured the
            unveiling of Cortana integration within the operating system, new
            Xbox-oriented features, Windows 10 Mobile, an updated Office Mobile
            suite, Surface Hub‍—‌a large-screened Windows 10 device for
            enterprise collaboration based upon Perceptive Pixel technology,
            along with HoloLens‑augmented reality eyewear and an associated
            platform for building apps that can render holograms through
            HoloLens.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additional developer-oriented details surrounding the "Universal
            Windows Platform" concept were revealed and discussed during
            Microsoft's Build developers' conference. Among them were the
            unveiling of "Islandwood", which provides a middleware toolchain for
            compiling Objective-C-based software (particularly iOS) to run as
            universal apps on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. A port of Candy
            Crush Saga made using the toolkit, which shared much of its code
            with the iOS version, was demonstrated, alongside the announcement
            that the King-developed game would be bundled with Windows 10 at
            launch.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the 2015 Ignite conference, Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated
            that Windows 10 would be the "last version of Windows", a statement
            reflecting the company's intent to apply the software as a service
            business model to Windows, with new versions and updates to be
            released over an indefinite period. In 2021, however, Microsoft
            announced that Windows 10 would be succeeded on compatible hardware
            by Windows 11 – and that Windows 10 support will end on October 14,
            2025, marking a departure from what had been dubbed "Windows as a
            service".

            On July 20, 2015, Microsoft began "Upgrade Your World", an
            advertising campaign centering on Windows 10, with the premiere of
            television commercials in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan,
            the United Kingdom, and the United States. The commercials focused
            on the tagline "A more human way to do", emphasizing new features
            and technologies supported by Windows 10 that sought to provide a
            more "personal" experience to users. The campaign culminated with
            launch events in thirteen cities on July 29, 2015, which celebrated
            "the unprecedented role our biggest fans played in the development
            of Windows 10".

          <p>
            On July 29, 2015, Microsoft officially announced that Windows 10
            would be released for retail purchase as a free upgrade from earlier
            versions of Windows. In comparison to previous Windows releases,
            which had a longer turnover between the release to manufacturing
            (RTM) and general release to allow for testing by vendors (and in
            some cases, the development of "upgrade kits" to prepare systems for
            installation of the new version), an HP executive explained that
            because it knew Microsoft targeted the operating system for a 2015
            release, the company was able to optimize its then-current and
            upcoming products for Windows 10 in advance of its release, negating
            the need for such a milestone.
          </p>

          <p>
            The general availability build of Windows 10, numbered 10240, was
            first released to Windows Insider channels for pre-launch testing on
            July 15, 2015, prior to its formal release. Although a Microsoft
            official said there would be no specific RTM build of Windows 10,
            10240 was described as an RTM build by media outlets because it was
            released to all Windows Insider members at once (rather than to
            users on the "Fast ring" first), it no longer carried pre-release
            branding and desktop watermark text, and its build number had
            mathematical connections to the number 10 in reference to the
            operating system's naming. The Enterprise edition was released to
            volume licensing on August 1, 2015.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 10 is distributed digitally through the "Media Creation
            Tool", which is functionally identical to the Windows 8 online
            installer, and can also be used to generate an ISO image or USB
            install media. In-place upgrades are supported from most editions of
            Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 and Windows 8.1 with Update 1, while
            users with Windows 8 must first upgrade to Windows 8.1. Changing
            between architectures (e.g., upgrading from 32-bit edition to a
            64-bit editions) via in-place upgrades is not supported; a clean
            installation is required. In-place upgrades may be rolled back to
            the device's previous version of Windows, provided that 30 days have
            not passed since installation, and backup files were not removed
            using Disk Cleanup.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 10 was available in 190 countries and 111 languages upon its
            launch, and as part of efforts to "re-engage" with users in China,
            Microsoft also announced that it would partner with Qihoo and
            Tencent to help promote and distribute Windows 10 in China, and that
            Chinese PC maker Lenovo would provide assistance at its service
            centers and retail outlets for helping users upgrade to Windows 10.
            At retail, Windows 10 is priced similarly to editions of Windows
            8.1, with U.S. prices set at $119 and $199 for Windows 10 Home and
            Pro respectively. A Windows 10 Pro Pack license allows upgrades from
            Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro. Retail copies only ship on USB
            flash drive media; however, system builder copies still ship as
            DVD-ROM media. New devices shipping with Windows 10 were also
            released during the operating system's launch window.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Free upgrade offer</summary>
          <p>
            During its first year of availability, upgrade licenses for Windows
            10 could be obtained at no charge for devices with a genuine license
            for an eligible edition of Windows 7 or 8.1.
          </p>

          <p>
            This offer did not apply to Enterprise editions, as customers under
            an active Software Assurance (SA) contract with upgrade rights are
            entitled to obtain Windows 10 Enterprise under their existing terms.
            All users running non-genuine copies of Windows, and those without
            an existing Windows 7 or 8/8.1 license, were ineligible for this
            promotion; although upgrades from a non-genuine version were
            possible, they result in a non-genuine copy of 10.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the general availability build of Windows 10 (the original
            release), to activate and generate the "digital entitlement" for
            Windows 10, the operating system must have first been installed as
            an in-place upgrade. During the free upgrade, a "genuineticket.xml"
            file is created in the background and the system's motherboard
            details are registered with a Microsoft Product Activation server.
            Once installed, the operating system can be reinstalled on that
            particular system via normal means without a product key, and the
            system's license will automatically be detected via online
            activation – in essence, the Microsoft Product Activation Server
            will remember the system's motherboard and give it the green light
            for product re-activation. Because of installation issues with
            Upgrade Only installs, the November Update (version 1511) included
            additional activation mechanisms. This build treated Windows 7 and
            Windows 8/8.1 product keys as Windows 10 product keys, meaning they
            could be entered during installation to activate the free license,
            without the need to upgrade first to "activate" the hardware with
            Microsoft's activation servers. For major Original Equipment
            Manufacturers (OEMs), Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 OEM product keys
            are embedded in the firmware of the motherboard and if the correct
            edition of Windows 10 is present on the installation media, they are
            automatically inputted during installation. Since the release of the
            Fall Creators Update (version 1709), Microsoft decided to release
            multi-edition installation media, to alleviate installation and
            product activation issues users experienced because of accidentally
            installing the wrong edition of Windows 10.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Windows Insider Preview version of Windows 10 automatically
            updated itself to the generally released version as part of the
            version progression and continues to be updated to new beta builds,
            as it had throughout the testing process. Microsoft explicitly
            stated that Windows Insider was not a valid upgrade path for those
            running a version of Windows that is ineligible for the upgrade
            offer; although, if it was not installed with a license carried over
            from an in-place upgrade to 10 Insider Preview from Windows 7 or
            8.1, the Insider Preview does remain activated as long as the user
            does not exit the Windows Insider program.
          </p>

          <p>
            The offer was promoted and delivered via the "Get Windows 10"
            application (also known as GWX), which was automatically installed
            via Windows Update ahead of Windows 10's release, and activated on
            systems deemed eligible for the upgrade offer. Via a notification
            area icon, users could access an application that advertised Windows
            10 and the free upgrade offer, check device compatibility, and
            "reserve" an automatic download of the operating system upon its
            release. On July 28, a pre-download process began in which Windows
            10 installation files were downloaded to some computers that had
            reserved it. Microsoft said that those who reserved Windows 10 would
            be able to install it through GWX in a phased rollout process. The
            operating system could alternatively be downloaded at any time using
            a separate "Media Creation Tool" setup program, that allows for the
            creation of DVD or USB installation media.
          </p>

          <p>
            In May 2016, Microsoft announced that the free upgrade offer would
            be extended to users of assistive technologies; however, Microsoft
            did not implement any means of certifying eligibility for this
            offer, which some outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to
            fraudulently obtain a free Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft said that
            the offer is not intended to be used in this manner. In November
            2017, Microsoft announced that this program would end on December
            31, 2017.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, another method was found that allowed Windows 7 and 8/8.1
            users to upgrade to Windows 10 using existing licenses, even though
            the free upgrade offers officially ended in 2017. Some outlets have
            continued to promote it as a free method of upgrading from the
            now-unsupported Windows 7. This free upgrade method was officially
            closed by Microsoft on September 20, 2023. However, as of 2024,
            there are some reports that it still works, under certain
            conditions.

          Windows 10 makes its user experience and functionality more consistent
          between different classes of device, and addresses many shortcomings
          of the user interface introduced in Windows 8. Windows 10 Mobile, the
          successor to Windows Phone 8.1, shared some user interface elements
          and apps with its PC counterpart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 10 supports universal apps, an expansion of the Metro-style
          first introduced in Windows 8. Universal apps can be designed to run
          across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code
          - including PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems, Xbox One,
          Surface Hub and Mixed Reality. The Windows user interface was revised
          to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a
          touchscreen-optimized interface based on available input devices -
          particularly on 2-in-1 PCs. Both interfaces include an updated Start
          menu which incorporates elements of Windows 7's traditional Start menu
          with the tiles of Windows 8. Windows 10 also introduced the Microsoft
          Edge web browser, a virtual desktop system, a window and desktop
          management feature called Task View, support for fingerprint and face
          recognition login, new security features for enterprise environments,
          and DirectX 12.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Windows Runtime app ecosystem was revised into the Universal
          Windows Platform (UWP). These universal apps are made to run across
          multiple platforms and device classes, including smartphones, tablets,
          Xbox One consoles, and other devices compatible with Windows 10.
          Windows apps share code across platforms, have responsive designs that
          adapt to the needs of the device and available inputs, can synchronize
          data between Windows 10 devices (including notifications, credentials,
          and allowing cross-platform multiplayer for games), and are
          distributed through the Microsoft Store (rebranded from Windows Store
          since September 2017). Developers can allow "cross-buys", where
          purchased licenses for an app apply to all of the user's compatible
          devices, rather than only the one they purchased on (e.g., a user
          purchasing an app on PC is also entitled to use the smartphone version
          at no extra cost).
        </p>

        <p>
          The ARM version of Windows 10 allows running applications for x86
          processors through 32-bit software emulation.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Windows 10, the Microsoft Store serves as a unified storefront for
          apps, video content, and eBooks. Windows 10 also allows web apps and
          desktop software (using either Win32 or .NET Framework) to be packaged
          for distribution on the Microsoft Store. Desktop software distributed
          through Windows Store is packaged using the App-V system to allow
          sandboxing.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">System security</summary>
          <p>
            Windows 10 incorporates multi-factor authentication technology based
            upon standards developed by the FIDO Alliance. The operating system
            includes improved support for biometric authentication through the
            Windows Hello platform. Devices with supported cameras (requiring
            infrared illumination, such as Intel RealSense) allow users to log
            in with iris or face recognition, similarly to Kinect. Devices with
            supported readers allow users to log in through fingerprint
            recognition. Support was also added for palm-vein scanning through a
            partnership with Fujitsu in February 2018. Credentials are stored
            locally and protected using asymmetric encryption.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2017, researchers demonstrated that Windows Hello could be
            bypassed on fully-updated Windows 10 version 1703 with a color
            printout of a person's picture taken with an IR camera. In 2021,
            researchers were again able to bypass the Windows Hello
            functionalities by using custom hardware disguised as a camera,
            which presented an IR photo of the owner's face.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to biometric authentication, Windows Hello supports
            authentication with a PIN. By default, Windows requires a PIN to
            consist of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex
            PINs. However, a PIN is not a simpler password. While passwords are
            transmitted to domain controllers, PINs are not. They are tied to
            one device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed
            by a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create
            strong asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token
            transmitted to the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas
            weak passwords may be broken via rainbow tables, TPM causes the
            much-simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to brute-force attacks.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication
            was provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to
            be confused with the Passport platform of 1998). Later, Passport was
            merged into Windows Hello.
          </p>

          <p>
            The enterprise edition of Windows 10 offers additional security
            features; administrators can set up policies for the automatic
            encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from
            accessing encrypted data, and enable Device Guard‍—‌a system which
            allows administrators to enforce a high-security environment by
            blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a
            trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect
            against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its
            operation remains separated from the operating system itself.

          <p>
            The console windows based on Windows Console (for any console app,
            not just PowerShell and Windows Command Prompt) can now be resized
            without any restrictions, can be made to cover the full screen by
            pressing Alt + Enter, and can use standard keyboard shortcuts, such
            as those for cut, copy, and paste. Other features such as word wrap
            and transparency were also added. These functions can be disabled to
            revert to the legacy console if needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Anniversary Update added Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL),
            which allows the installation of a user space environment from a
            supported Linux distribution that runs natively on Windows. The
            subsystem translates Linux system calls to those of the Windows NT
            kernel (only claims full system call compatibility as of WSL 2,
            included in a later Windows update). The environment can execute the
            Bash shell and 64-bit command-line programs (WSL 2 also supports
            32-bit Linux programs and graphics, assuming supporting software
            installed, and GPUs support for other uses). Windows applications
            cannot be executed from the Linux environment, and vice versa. Linux
            distributions for Windows Subsystem for Linux are obtained through
            Microsoft Store. The feature initially supported an Ubuntu-based
            environment; Microsoft announced in May 2017 that it would add
            Fedora and OpenSUSE
          </p>
          environment options as well.

          <summary class="level-two">Storage requirements</summary>
          <p>
            To reduce the storage footprint of the operating system, Windows 10
            automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the
            storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5 GB for 32-bit
            systems and 2.6 GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used
            is dependent on a performance assessment performed during
            installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be
            used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the
            Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making
            a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and
            updates to remain installed following the operation, and further
            reducing the amount of space required for Windows 10 by up to 12 GB.
            These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1
            Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with
            flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the
            compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery.
            Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows
            users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is
            being used by different types of files, and determine whether
            certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card
            by default.

            Windows 10 introduces Microsoft Edge, a new default web browser. It
            initially featured a new standards-compliant rendering engine
            derived from Trident, and also includes annotation tools and
            integration with other Microsoft platforms present within Windows
            10. Internet Explorer 11 is maintained on Windows 10 for
            compatibility purposes, but is deprecated in favor of Edge and,
            since mid-June 2022, is no longer supported on editions which follow
            Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy. The initial version of Edge was
            later succeeded by a new iteration derived from the Chromium Project
            and Blink layout engine, which replaced the previous EdgeHTML-based
            version of Edge (renamed "Microsoft Edge Legacy"), and is bundled
            with the OS by default from build 20H2 onwards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 10 incorporates a universal search box located alongside the
            Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed into a
            single button. Previous versions featured Microsoft's intelligent
            personal assistant Cortana, which was first introduced with Windows
            Phone 8.1 in 2014, and supports both text and voice input. Many of
            its features are a direct carryover from Windows Phone, including
            integration with Bing, setting reminders, a Notebook feature for
            managing personal information, as well as searching for files,
            playing music, launching applications and setting reminders or
            sending emails. Since the November 2019 update, Microsoft has begun
            to downplay Cortana as part of a repositioning of the product
            towards enterprise use, with the May 2020 update removing its
            Windows shell integration and consumer-oriented features.

            Microsoft Family Safety is replaced by Microsoft Family, a parental
            controls system that applies across Windows platforms and Microsoft
            online services. Users can create a designated family, and monitor
            and restrict the actions of users designated as children, such as
            access to websites, enforcing age ratings on Microsoft Store
            purchases, and other restrictions. The service can also send weekly
            e-mail reports to parents detailing a child's computer usage. Unlike
            previous versions of Windows, child accounts in a family must be
            associated with a Microsoft account - which allows these settings to
            apply across all Windows 10 devices that a particular child is
            using.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 10 also offers the Wi-Fi Sense feature originating from
            Windows Phone 8.1; users can optionally have their device
            automatically connect to suggested open hotspots, and share their
            home network's password with contacts (either via Skype, People, or
            Facebook) so they may automatically connect to the network on a
            Windows 10 device without needing to manually enter its password.
            Credentials are stored in an encrypted form on Microsoft servers and
            sent to the devices of the selected contacts. Passwords are not
            viewable by the guest user, and the guest user is not allowed to
            access other computers or devices on the network. Wi-Fi Sense is not
            usable on 802.1X-encrypted networks. Adding "_optout" at the end of
            the SSID will also block the corresponding network from being used
            for this feature.

            Universal calling and messaging apps for Windows 10 are built in as
            of the November 2015 update: Messaging, Skype Video, and Phone.
            These offer built-in alternatives to the Skype download and sync
            with Windows 10 Mobile.

            Windows 10 provides greater integration with the Xbox ecosystem.
            Xbox SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox Console Companion (formerly
            the Xbox app), which allows users to browse their game library
            (including both PC and Xbox console games), and Game DVR is also
            available using a keyboard shortcut, allowing users to save the last
            30 seconds of gameplay as a video that can be shared to Xbox Live,
            OneDrive, or elsewhere. Windows 10 also allows users to control and
            play games from an Xbox One console over a local network. The Xbox
            Live SDK allows application developers to incorporate Xbox Live
            functionality into their apps, and future wireless Xbox One
            accessories, such as controllers, are supported on Windows with an
            adapter. Microsoft also intends to allow cross-purchases and save
            synchronization between Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of games;
            Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are
            intended as being exclusive to Windows 10 and Xbox One.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 10 adds native game recording and screenshot capture ability
            using the newly introduced Game Bar. Users can also have the OS
            continuously record gameplay in the background, which then allows
            the user to save the last few moments of gameplay to the storage
            device.

            Media Player and other applications. Windows Media Center is no
            longer bundled.
          </p>

          <p>
            Windows 10 includes DirectX 12, alongside WDDM 2.0. Unveiled March
            2014 at GDC, DirectX 12 aims to provide "console-level efficiency"
            with "closer to the metal" access to hardware resources, and reduced
            CPU and graphics driver overhead. Most of the performance
            improvements are achieved through low-level programming, which allow
            developers to use resources more efficiently and reduce
            single-threaded CPU bottlenecking caused by abstraction through
            higher level APIs. DirectX 12 will also feature support for vendor
            agnostic multi-GPU setups. WDDM 2.0 introduces a new virtual memory
            management and allocation system to reduce workload on the
            kernel-mode driver.

          Windows 10 is available in five main editions for personal computing
          devices; the Home and Pro editions of which are sold at retail in most
          countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Home is aimed
          at home users, while Pro is aimed at power users and small businesses.
          Each edition of Windows 10 includes all of the capabilities and
          features of the edition below it, and adds additional features
          oriented towards its market segments; for example, Pro adds additional
          networking and security features such as BitLocker, Device Guard,
          Windows Update for Business, and the ability to join a domain.
          Enterprise and Education, contain additional features aimed towards

          As part of Microsoft's unification strategies, Windows products that
          are based on Windows 10's common platform but meant for specialized
          platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather
          than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's
          Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was
          branded as Windows 10 Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will
          also be produced for embedded systems, along with Windows 10 IoT Core,
          which is designed specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost
          devices and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar in scope
          to Windows Embedded Compact.

          On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S (referred to in leaks
          as Windows 10 Cloud), a feature-limited edition of Windows 10 which
          was designed primarily for devices in the education market (competing,
          in particular, with ChromeOS netbooks), such as the Surface Laptop
          that Microsoft also unveiled at this time. The OS restricts software
          installation to applications obtained from Microsoft Store; the device
          may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to enable unrestricted
          software installation. As a time-limited promotion, Microsoft stated
          that this upgrade would be free on the Surface Laptop until March 31,
          2018. Windows 10 S also contains a faster initial setup and login
          process, and allows devices to be provisioned using a USB drive with
          the Windows Intune for Education platform. In March 2018, Microsoft
          announced that Windows 10 S would be deprecated because of market
          confusion and would be replaced by "S Mode", an OEM option wherein
          Windows defaults to only allowing applications to be installed from
          Microsoft Store, but does not require payment in order to disable
          these restrictions.

        <p>
          Windows 10 makes its user experience and functionality more consistent
          between different classes of device, and addresses many shortcomings
          of the user interface introduced in Windows 8. Windows 10 Mobile, the
          successor to Windows Phone 8.1, shared some user interface elements
          and apps with its PC counterpart. Windows 10 supports universal apps,
          an expansion of the Metro-style first introduced in Windows 8.
          Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft
          product families with nearly identical code including PCs, tablets,
          smartphones, embedded systems, Xbox One, Surface Hub and Mixed

          between a mouse-oriented interface and a touchscreen-optimized
          interface based on available input devices - particularly on 2-in-1
          PCs. Both interfaces include an updated Start menu which incorporates
          elements of Windows 7's traditional Start menu with the tiles of
          Windows 8. Windows 10 also introduced the Microsoft Edge web browser,
          a virtual desktop system, a window and desktop management feature
          called Task View, support for fingerprint and face recognition login,
          new security features for enterprise environments, and DirectX 12. The
          Windows Runtime app ecosystem was revised into the Universal Windows
          Platform (UWP). These universal apps are made to run across multiple
          platforms and device classes, including smartphones, tablets, Xbox One
          consoles, and other devices compatible with Windows 10. Windows apps
          share code across platforms, have responsive designs that adapt to the
          needs of the device and available inputs, can synchronize data between
          Windows 10 devices (including notifications, credentials, and allowing
          cross-platform multiplayer for games), and are distributed through the
          Microsoft Store (rebranded from Windows Store since September 2017).
          Developers can allow "cross-buys", where purchased licenses for an app
          apply to all of the user's compatible devices, rather than only the
          device they purchased the app on (e.g., a user purchasing an app on PC
          is also entitled to use the smartphone version at no extra cost). The
          ARM version of Windows 10 allows running applications for x86
          processors through 32-bit software emulation. On Windows 10, the
          Microsoft Store serves as a unified storefront for apps, video
          content, and eBooks. Windows 10 also allows web apps and desktop
          software to be packaged for distribution on the Microsoft Store.
          Desktop software distributed through Windows Store is packaged using
          the App-V system to allow sandboxing.

          A new iteration of the Start menu is used on the Windows 10 desktop,
          with a list of places and other options on the left side, and tiles
          representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and
          expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in
          Tablet mode. A new virtual desktop system was added by a feature known
          as Task View, which displays all open windows and allows users to
          switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Universal
          apps, which previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now
          be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program
          windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them
          to the corner. When a window is snapped to one side of the screen,
          Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window
          to fill the unused side of the screen (called "Snap Assist") The
          Windows system icons have also been changed.

          Windows 10 is designed to adapt its user interface based on the type
          of device being used and available input methods. It offers two
          separate user interface modes: a user interface optimized for mouse
          and keyboard, and a "Tablet mode" designed for touchscreens. Users can
          toggle between these two modes at any time, and Windows can prompt or
          automatically switch when certain events occur, such as disabling
          Tablet mode on a tablet if a keyboard or mouse is plugged in, or when
          a 2-in-1 PC is switched to its laptop state. In Tablet mode, programs
          default to a maximized view, and the taskbar contains a back button
          and hides buttons for opened or pinned programs by default; Task View
          is used instead to switch between programs. The full screen Start menu
          is used in this mode, similarly to Windows 8, but scrolls vertically
          instead of horizontally.

            A screenshot of Windows 10. The UI is quite a mix, integrating
            elements of Windows 7 and 8 while using the Metro theme. This
            screenshot shows a modern and much more refined UI compared to
            earlier versions.
