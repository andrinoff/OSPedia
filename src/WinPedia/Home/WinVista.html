        Windows Vista is a major release of the Windows NT series of operating
        systems developed by Microsoft. It was the direct successor to Windows
        XP, which was released five years earlier. This was then the longest
        time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows. It was
        released to manufacturing on November 8, 2006, and over the following
        two months, it was released in stages to business customers, original
        equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and retail channels. On January 30,
        2007, it was released internationally and was made available for
        purchase and download from the Windows Marketplace; it is the first
        release of Windows to be made available through a digital distribution
        platform.

      <p>
        Development of Windows Vista began in 2001 under the codename
        "Longhorn". It was originally meant to be a minor successor to Windows
        XP, but it gradually included numerous new features from the then-next
        major release of Windows codenamed "Blackcomb", after which it was
        repositioned as a major release of Windows, and it subsequently
        underwent a period of protracted development that was unprecedented for
        Microsoft. Most new features were prominently based on a new
        presentation layer codenamed Avalon, a new communications architecture
        codenamed Indigo, and a relational storage platform codenamed WinFS —
        all built on the .NET Framework; however, this proved to be untenable
        due to incompleteness of technologies and ways in which new features
        were added, and Microsoft reset the project in 2004. Many features were
        eventually reimplemented after the reset, but Microsoft ceased using
        managed code to develop the operating system.
      </p>

      <p>
        New features of Windows Vista include a graphical user interface and
        visual style referred to as Windows Aero; a content index and desktop
        search platform called Windows Search; new peer-to-peer technologies to
        simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices on a home
        network; and new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker. Windows
        Vista included .NET Framework version 3.0, allowing software developers
        to write applications without traditional Windows APIs. There are major
        architectural overhauls to audio, display, network, and print
        sub-systems; deployment, installation, servicing, and startup procedures
        are also revised. It is the first release of Windows built on
        Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing initiative and emphasized security
        with the introduction of many new security and safety features such as
        BitLocker and the infamous User Account Control.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ambitiousness and scope of these changes, and the abundance of new
        features earned positive reviews, but Windows Vista was the subject of
        frequent negative press and significant criticism. Criticism of Windows
        Vista focused on driver, peripheral, and program incompatibility;
        digital rights management; excessive authorization from the new User
        Account Control; inordinately high system requirements when contrasted
        with Windows XP; its protracted development; longer boot time; and more
        restrictive product licensing. Windows Vista deployment and satisfaction
        rates were consequently lower than those of Windows XP, and it is
        considered a market failure; however, its use surpassed Microsoft's
        pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users
        (with an estimated 330 million users by 2009). Two service packs were
        released, in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Windows Vista was succeeded by
        Windows 7 in 2009, and on October 22, 2010 Microsoft ceased retail
        distribution of Windows Vista; OEM supply ceased a year later.
        Mainstream support for Windows Vista ended on April 10, 2012 and
        extended support ended on April 11, 2017.

        <p>
          Microsoft began work on Windows Vista, known at the time by its
          codename "Longhorn", in May 2001, five months before the release of
          Windows XP. It was originally expected to ship in October 2003 as a
          minor step between Windows XP and "Blackcomb", which was planned to be
          the company's next major operating system release. Gradually,
          "Longhorn" assimilated many of the important new features and
          technologies slated for Blackcomb, resulting in the release date being
          pushed back several times in three years. In some builds of Longhorn,
          their license agreement said "For the Microsoft product codenamed
          'Whistler'". Many of Microsoft's developers were also re-tasked to
          build updates to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to strengthen
          security. Faced with ongoing delays and concerns about feature creep,
          Microsoft announced on August 27, 2004, that it had revised its plans.
          For this reason, Longhorn was reset to start work on componentizing
          the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 codebase, and over time
          re-incorporating the features that would be intended for an actual
          operating system release. However, some previously announced features
          such as WinFS were dropped or postponed, and a new software
          development methodology called the Security Development Lifecycle was
          incorporated to address concerns with the security of the Windows
          codebase, which is programmed in C, C++ and assembly. Longhorn became
          known as Vista in 2005. Vista in Spanish means view.
        </p>

        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Longhorn</summary>
          <p>
            The early development stages of Longhorn were generally
            characterized by incremental improvements and updates to Windows XP.
            During this period, Microsoft was fairly quiet about what was being
            worked on, as their marketing and public relations efforts were more
            strongly focused on Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, which was
            released in April 2003. Occasional builds of Longhorn were leaked
            onto popular file sharing networks such as IRC, BitTorrent, eDonkey
            and various newsgroups, and so most of what is known about builds
            before the first sanctioned development release of Longhorn in May
            2003 is derived from these builds.
          </p>

          <p>
            After several months of relatively little news or activity from
            Microsoft with Longhorn, Microsoft released Build 4008, which had
            made an appearance on the Internet around February 28, 2003. It was
            also privately handed out to a select group of software developers.
            As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained several
            small improvements, including a modified blue "Plex" theme and a
            new, simplified Windows Image-based installer that operates in
            graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the
            operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP
            on the same hardware. An optional "new taskbar" was introduced that
            was thinner than the previous build and displayed the time
            differently. The most notable visual and functional difference,
            however, came with Windows Explorer. The incorporation of the Plex
            theme made blue the dominant color of the entire application. The
            Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely replaced with a
            large horizontal pane that appeared under the toolbars. A new search
            interface allowed for filtering of results, searching for Windows
            help, and natural-language queries that would be used to integrate
            with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed. The
            "view modes" were also replaced with a single slider that would
            resize the icons in real-time, in the list, thumbnail, or details
            mode, depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also made
            more visible and more easily editable, with more active
            encouragement to fill out missing pieces of information. Also of
            note was the conversion of Windows Explorer to being a .NET
            application.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most builds of Longhorn and Vista were identified by a label that
            was always displayed in the bottom-right corner of the desktop. A
            typical build label would look like "Longhorn Build
            3683.Lab06_N.020923-1821". Higher build numbers did not
            automatically mean that the latest features from every development
            team at Microsoft was included. Typically, a team working on a
            certain feature or subsystem would generate their working builds
            which developers would test with, and when the code was deemed
            stable, all the changes would be incorporated back into the main
            development tree at once. At Microsoft, several "Build labs" exist
            where the compilation of the entirety of Windows can be performed by
            a team. The name of the lab in which any given build originated is
            shown as part of the build label, and the date and time of the build
            follow that. Some builds (such as Beta 1 and Beta 2) only display
            the build label in the version information dialog (Winver). The
            icons used in these builds are from Windows XP.

            At the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) in May 2003,
            Microsoft gave their first public demonstrations of the new Desktop
            Window Manager and Aero. The demonstrations were done on a revised
            build 4015 which was never released. Several sessions for developers
            and hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new
            features, as well as the Next-Generation Secure Computing Base
            (previously known as "Palladium"), which at the time was Microsoft's
            proposed solution for creating a secure computing environment
            whereby any given component of the system could be deemed "trusted".
            Also at this conference, Microsoft reiterated their roadmap for
            delivering Longhorn, pointing to an "early 2005" release date.

          <p>
            By 2004, it had become obvious to the Windows team at Microsoft that
            they were losing sight of what needed to be done to complete the
            next version of Windows and ship it to customers. Internally, some
            Microsoft employees were describing the Longhorn project as "another
            Cairo" or "Cairo.NET", referring to the Cairo development project
            that the company embarked on through the first half of the 1990s,
            which never resulted in a shipping operating system (though nearly
            all the technologies developed in that time did end up in Windows 95
            and Windows NT). Microsoft was shocked in 2005 by Apple's release of
            Mac OS X Tiger. It offered only a limited subset of features planned
            for Longhorn, in particular fast file searching and integrated
            graphics and sound processing, but appeared to have impressive
            reliability and performance compared to contemporary Longhorn
            builds. Most Longhorn builds had major Windows Explorer system leaks
            which prevented the OS from performing well, and added more
            confusion to the development teams in later builds with more and
            more code being developed which failed to reach stability.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a September 23, 2005 front-page article in The Wall Street
            Journal, Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin, who had overall
            responsibility for the development and delivery of Windows,
            explained how development of Longhorn had been "crashing into the
            ground" due in large part to the haphazard methods by which features
            were introduced and integrated into the core of the operating
            system, without a clear focus on an end-product. Allchin went on to
            explain how in December 2003, he enlisted the help of two other
            senior executives, Brian Valentine and Amitabh Srivastava, the
            former being experienced with shipping software at Microsoft, most
            notably Windows Server 2003, and the latter having spent his career
            at Microsoft researching and developing methods of producing
            high-quality testing systems. Srivastava employed a team of core
            architects to visually map out the entirety of the Windows operating
            system, and to proactively work towards a development process that
            would enforce high levels of code quality, reduce interdependencies
            between components, and in general, "not make things worse with
            Vista". Since Microsoft decided that Longhorn needed to be further
            componentized, work started on builds (known as the Omega-13 builds,
            named after a time travel device in the film Galaxy Quest) that
            would componentize existing Windows Server 2003 source code, and
            over time add back functionality as development progressed. Future
            Longhorn builds would start from Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1
            and continue from there.
          </p>

          <p>
            This change, announced internally to Microsoft employees on August
            26, 2004, began in earnest in September, though it would take
            several more months before the new development process and build
            methodology would be used by all of the development teams. A number
            of complaints came from individual developers, and Bill Gates
            himself, that the new development process was going to be
            prohibitively difficult to work within.

          <summary class="level-two">As Windows Vista</summary>
          <p>
            By approximately November 2004, the company had considered several
            names for the final release, ranging from simple to fanciful and
            inventive. In the end, Microsoft chose Windows Vista as confirmed on
            July 22, 2005, believing it to be a "wonderful intersection of what
            the product really does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates
            with customers, and their needs". Group Project Manager Greg
            Sullivan told Paul Thurrott "You want the PC to adapt to you and
            help you cut through the clutter to focus on what's important to
            you. That's what Windows Vista is all about: "bringing clarity to
            your world" (a reference to the three marketing points of
            Vista—Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on what matters
            to you". Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also loved the name,
            saying that "Vista creates the right imagery for the new product
            capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities
            of what can be done with Windows—making people's passions come
            alive."
          </p>

          <p>
            After Longhorn was named Windows Vista in July 2005, an
            unprecedented beta-test program was started, involving hundreds of
            thousands of volunteers and companies. In September of that year,
            Microsoft started releasing regular Community Technology Previews
            (CTP) to beta testers from July 2005 to February 2006. The first of
            these was distributed at the 2005 Microsoft Professional Developers
            Conference, and was subsequently released to beta testers and
            Microsoft Developer Network subscribers. The builds that followed
            incorporated most of the planned features for the final product, as
            well as a number of changes to the user interface, based largely on
            feedback from beta testers. Windows Vista was deemed
            feature-complete with the release of the "February CTP", released on
            February 22, 2006, and much of the remainder of the work between
            that build and the final release of the product focused on
            stability, performance, application and driver compatibility, and
            documentation. Beta 2, released in late May, was the first build to
            be made available to the general public through Microsoft's Customer
            Preview Program. It was downloaded over 5 million times. Two release
            candidates followed in September and October, both of which were
            made available to a large number of users.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the Intel Developer Forum on March 9, 2006, Microsoft announced a
            change in their plans to support EFI in Windows Vista. The UEFI 2.0
            specification (which replaced EFI 1.10) was not completed until
            early 2006, and at the time of Microsoft's announcement, no firmware
            manufacturers had completed a production implementation which could
            be used for testing. As a result, the decision was made to postpone
            the introduction of UEFI support to Windows; support for UEFI on
            64-bit platforms was postponed until Vista Service Pack 1 and
            Windows Server 2008 and 32-bit UEFI would not be supported, as
            Microsoft did not expect many such systems to be built because the
            market was quickly moving to 64-bit processors.
          </p>

          <p>
            While Microsoft had originally hoped to have the consumer versions
            of the operating system available worldwide in time for the 2006
            holiday shopping season, it announced in March 2006 that the release
            date would be pushed back to January 2007 in order to give the
            company—and the hardware and software companies that Microsoft
            depends on for providing device drivers—additional time to prepare.
            Because a release to manufacturing (RTM) build is the final version
            of code shipped to retailers and other distributors, the purpose of
            a pre-RTM build is to eliminate any last "show-stopper" bugs that
            may prevent the code from responsibly being shipped to customers, as
            well as anything else that consumers may find troublesome. Thus, it
            is unlikely that any major new features would be introduced;
            instead, work would focus on Vista's fit and finish. In just a few
            days, developers had managed to drop Vista's bug count from over
            2470 on September 22 to just over 1400 by the time RC2 shipped in
            early October. However, they still had a way to go before Vista was
            ready to RTM. Microsoft's internal processes required Vista's bug
            count to drop to 500 or fewer before the product could go into
            escrow for RTM. For most of the pre-RTM builds, only 32-bit editions
            were released.

            On June 14, 2006, Windows developer Philip Su posted a blog entry
            which decried the development process of Windows Vista, stating that
            "The code is way too complicated, and that the pace of coding has
            been tremendously slowed down by overbearing process." The same post
            also described Windows Vista as having approximately 50 million
            lines of code, with about 2,000 developers working on the product.
            During a demonstration of the speech recognition feature new to
            Windows Vista at Microsoft's Financial Analyst Meeting on July 27,
            2006, the software recognized the phrase "Dear mom" as "Dear aunt".
            After several failed attempts to correct the error, the sentence
            eventually became "Dear aunt, let's set so double the killer delete
            select all". A developer with Vista's speech recognition team later
            explained that there was a bug with the build of Vista that was
            causing the microphone gain level to be set very high, resulting in
            the audio being received by the speech recognition software being
            "incredibly distorted".

            Windows Vista build 5824 (October 17, 2006) was supposed to be the
            RTM release, but a bug, where the OOBE hangs at the start of the
            WinSAT Assessment (if upgraded from Windows XP), requiring the user
            to terminate msoobe.exe by pressing Shift+F10 to open Command Prompt
            using either command-line tools or Task Manager prevented this,
            damaging development and lowering the chance that it would hit its
            January 2007 deadline.

            Development of Windows Vista came to an end when Microsoft announced
            that it had been finalized on November 8, 2006, and was concluded by
            co-president of Windows development, Jim Allchin. The RTM's build
            number had also jumped to 6000 to reflect Vista's internal version
            number, NT 6.0. Jumping RTM build numbers is common practice among
            consumer-oriented Windows versions, like Windows 98 (build 1998),
            Windows 98 SE (build 2222), Windows Me (build 3000) or Windows XP
            (build 2600), as compared to the business-oriented versions like
            Windows 2000 (build 2195) or Server 2003 (build 3790). On November
            16, 2006, Microsoft made the final build available to MSDN and
            Technet Plus subscribers. A business-oriented Enterprise edition was
            made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006.
            Windows Vista was launched for general customer availability on
            January 30, 2007.

          New features introduced by Windows Vista are very numerous,
          encompassing significant functionality not available in its
          predecessors. Do not explore this in detail if you simply want a brief
          list of features. Many new features include changes to the user
          interface, core, security, system management, features for developers
          and the installation process. A list of these features include:

            <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh"
              >Changes to the User Interface: </span
            >Windows Vista introduced a new visual theme, Aero, which replaced
            Windows XP's Luna theme.

            <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">Programs:</span>
            Many new applications were introduced with Windows Vista, including
            Internet Explorer 7, Media Player 11, Windows Defender, Windows
            Calendar, Windows Mail, Windows Photo Viewer and many more.

              >Changes and improvements to the core:</span
            >
            Vista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive, which
            employ fast flash memory (located on USB flash drives and hybrid
            hard disk drives) to improve system performance by caching commonly
            used programs and data. As part of the redesign of the networking
            architecture, IPv6 has been fully incorporated into the operating
            system and a number of performance improvements have been
            introduced, such as TCP window scaling. For graphics, Vista
            introduces a new Windows Display Driver Model and a major revision
            to Direct3D. The new driver model facilitates the new Desktop Window
            Manager, which provides the tearing-free desktop and special effects
            that are the cornerstones of Windows Aero. At the core of the
            operating system, many improvements have been made to the memory
            manager, process scheduler and I/O scheduler.

              >New features and improvements to security:</span
            >
            Improved security was a primary design goal for Vista. Microsoft's
            Trustworthy Computing initiative, which aims to improve public trust
            in its products, has had a direct effect on its development. This
            effort has resulted in a number of new security and safety features
            and an Evaluation Assurance Level rating of 4+.

            >
            While much of the focus of Vista's new capabilities highlighted the
            new user interface, security technologies, and improvements to the
            core operating system, Microsoft also added new deployment and
            maintenance features

              >New features for developers:</span
            >
            Windows Vista includes a large number of new application programming
            interfaces. Chief among them is the inclusion of version 3.0 of the
            .NET Framework, which consists of a class library and Common
            Language Runtime. There are also significant new development APIs in
            the core of the operating system, notably the completely re-designed
            audio, networking, print, and video interfaces, major changes to the
            security infrastructure, improvements to the deployment and
            installation of applications ("ClickOnce" and Windows Installer
            4.0), new device driver development model ("Windows Driver
            Foundation"), Transactional NTFS, mobile computing API advancements
            (power management, Tablet PC Ink support, SideShow) and major
            updates to (or complete replacements of) many core subsystems such
            as Winlogon and CAPI.

            Windows Aero is the new graphical user interface, which Jim Allchin
            stated is an acronym for Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open.
            Microsoft intended the new interface to be cleaner and more
            aesthetically pleasing than those of previous Windows versions, and
            it features advanced visual effects such as blurred glass
            translucencies and dynamic glass reflections and smooth window
            animations. Laptop users report, however, that enabling Aero reduces
            battery life and reduces performance. Windows Aero requires a
            compositing window manager called Desktop Window Manager.

            Windows Shell offers a new range of organization, navigation, and
            search capabilities: Task Panes in Windows Explorer are removed,
            with the relevant tasks moved to a new command bar. The navigation
            pane can now be displayed when tasks are available, and it has been
            updated to include a new "Favorite Links" that houses shortcuts to
            common locations. An incremental search box now appears at all times
            in Windows Explorer. The address bar has been replaced with a
            breadcrumb navigation bar, which means that multiple locations in a
            hierarchy can be navigated without needing to go back and forth
            between locations. Icons now display thumbnails depicting contents
            of items and can be dynamically scaled in size (up to 256 × 256
            pixels). A new preview pane allows users to see thumbnails of items
            and play tracks, read contents of documents, and view photos when
            they are selected. Groups of items are now selectable and display
            the number of items in each group. A new details pane allows users
            to manage metadata. There are several new sharing features,
            including the ability to directly share files. The Start menu also
            now includes an incremental search box — allowing the user to press
            the Win key and start typing to instantly find an item or launch a
            program — and the All Programs list uses a vertical scroll bar
            instead of the cascading flyout menu of Windows XP.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Windows Search is a new content index desktop search platform that
              replaces the Indexing Service of previous Windows versions to
              enable incremental searches for files and non-file items —
              documents, emails, folders, programs, photos, tracks, and videos —
              and contents or details such as attributes, extensions, and
              filenames across compatible applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Sidebar is a translucent panel that hosts gadgets that
              display details such as feeds and sports scores on the Windows
              desktop; the Sidebar can be hidden and gadgets can also be placed
              on the desktop itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Internet Explorer 7 is a significant revision over Internet
              Explorer 6 with a new user interface comprising additional address
              bar features, a new search box, enhanced page zoom, RSS feed
              functionality, and support for tabbed browsing (with an optional
              "quick tabs" feature that shows thumbnails of each open tab).
              Anti-phishing software is introduced that combines client-side
              scanning with an optional online service; it checks with Microsoft
              the address being visited to determine its legitimacy, compares
              the address with a locally stored list of legitimate addresses,
              and uses heuristics to determine whether an address's
              characteristics are indicative of phishing attempts. In Windows
              Vista, it runs in isolation from other applications (protected
              mode); exploits and malicious software are restricted from writing
              to any location beyond Temporary Internet Files without explicit
              user consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Media Player 11 is a significant update to Microsoft's
              Windows Media Player for playing and organizing photos, tracks,
              and videos. New features include an updated GUI for the media
              library, disc spanning, enhanced audio fingerprinting, instant
              search capabilities, item organization features, synchronization
              features, the ability to share the media library over a network
              with other Windows Vista machines, Xbox 360 integration, and
              Windows Media Center Extender support.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Defender is an antispyware program with several
              configurable options for real-time protection, with settings to
              block and notify of changes to browser, security, and Windows
              settings; prohibit startup applications; and view
              network-connected applications and their addresses; users can
              optionally report detected threats through the Microsoft Active
              Protection Service to help stop new threats.
            </li>
            <li>
              Backup and Restore Center allows for the creation of periodic
              backups and backup schedules, as well as recovery from previous
              backups; backups are incremental, storing only subsequent changes,
              which minimizes disk space usage. Windows Vista Business, Windows
              Vista Enterprise, and Windows Vista Ultimate additionally include
              Windows Complete PC Backup that allows system images to be
              created, and this feature can be started from Windows Vista
              installation media so that images can be restored to a new hard
              disk or new hardware or if a PC has experienced hardware failures
              and it cannot boot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Calendar is a basic calendar application that integrates
              with Windows Contacts and Windows Mail; users can create
              appointments and tasks, publish calendars to the Internet or to a
              network share, receive reminders, send and receive calendar
              invitations, and share calendars with family members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Mail is the successor to Outlook Express that includes
              significant feature additions (many of which were previously
              exclusive to Microsoft Outlook) and introduces fundamental
              revisions to the identification process, storage architecture, and
              security structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Photo Gallery replaces Windows Picture and Fax Viewer; it
              can acquire photographs from digital cameras; adjust photograph
              effects; burn photographs to optical media; create
              Direct3D-accelerated slideshows; and reduce red eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Media Center previously exclusive to Windows XP Media
              Center Edition is available in Windows Vista Home Premium and
              Windows Vista Ultimate; it has been updated with many new features
              such as support for CableCARD, DVD/MPEG-2, HD content, and two
              dual-tuner cards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parental controls allow administrators to control and manage user
              activity (such as limiting the games that can be played or
              prohibiting specific contents of websites) of each standard user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Games including FreeCell, Hearts, Minesweeper, Solitaire, and
              Spider Solitaire have been rewritten in DirectX to take advantage
              of Windows Vista's new graphical capabilities. New games include
              Chess Titans (3D Chess), Mahjong Titans (3D Mahjong), and Purble
              Place (a collection consisting of a cake-creation game, a dress-up
              puzzle game, and a matching game oriented towards younger
              children). All in-box games in Windows Vista can be played with an
              Xbox 360 Controller.

            <li>
              Games Explorer is the central location for installed games that
              displays details such as covers, developers, genres, installation
              dates, play times, publishers, ratings, and versions. Customizable
              tasks for games are available; metadata for installed games can be
              updated from the Internet. Game-related settings such as audio
              options, community support options, game controller options,
              firewall settings, and parental controls are displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Mobility Center centralizes settings and statuses relevant
              to mobile computing such as battery life, connectivity status,
              display brightness, screen orientation, synchronization status,
              and volume level, and new options can be added by OEMs.

              Windows Fax and Scan allows machines to create, receive, scan, and
              send faxes, with the goal of making fax management identical to
              working with email; it is available in Windows Vista Business,
              Windows Vista Enterprise, and Windows Vista Ultimate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Meeting Space replaces NetMeeting and relies on People
              Near Me and WS-Discovery to identify participants on the local
              subnet or across the Internet; users can give control of their
              computers to other participants, project their desktops, send
              messages to participants, and share files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows HotStart enables compatible computers to start
              applications directly from startup or resume by the press of a
              button, which allows them to function as a consumer electronics
              device such as a DVD player.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shadow Copy (originally only available in Windows Server 2003)
              creates copies of files and folders on a scheduled basis, allowing
              users to recover multiple versions of deleted or overwritten files
              or folders. Incremental changes are saved by shadow copies, which
              helps to limit the disk space in use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Update is now a native client application; in previous
              versions of Windows, it was a web application that had to be
              accessed from a web browser. Automatic Updates can now
              automatically download and install Recommended updates (in
              addition to High Priority updates that could be automatically
              downloaded and installed in previous versions of Windows). The
              prompt that appears when an update is installed that requires a
              machine to be restarted has been revised, with new options to
              postpone an operating system restart indefinitely, by 10 minutes,
              by 1 hour, or by 4 hours (in Windows XP, users could only
              repeatedly dismiss the prompt to restart, or allow the machine to
              be restarted within 15 minutes of its appearance). Windows
              Defender definitions and Windows Mail spam filter are delivered
              through Windows Update.

              Windows SideShow delivers data such as messages and feeds from a
              personal computer to additional devices and displays, which makes
              data available in mobile scenarios; compatible devices could
              additionally transmit commands to applications, devices, or
              systems connected to a computer (e.g., a smart phone can control a
              presentation).

              Magnifier in Windows Vista can magnify the vector-based content of
              Windows Presentation Foundation applications without blurring the
              magnified content—it performs resolution-independent zooming—when
              the Desktop Window Manager is enabled; the release of .NET
              Framework 3.5 SP1 in 2008 removes this capability when installed
              in Windows Vista. Magnifier can now be docked to the bottom, left,
              right, or top of the screen. Microsoft also introduced the
              Magnification API so that developers can build solutions that
              magnify portions of the screen or that apply color effects.

              system a rating from 1.0 to 5.9; a system is rated during the
              out-of-box experience to determine if Windows Aero should be
              enabled.

            Vista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive, which
            employ fast flash memory (located on USB flash drives and hybrid
            hard disk drives) to improve system performance by caching commonly
            used programs and data. This manifests itself in improved battery
            life on notebook computers as well, since a hybrid drive can be spun
            down when not in use. Another new technology called SuperFetch
            utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze usage patterns to
            allow Windows Vista to make intelligent decisions about what content
            should be present in system memory at any given time. It uses almost
            all the extra RAM as disk cache. In conjunction with SuperFetch, an
            automatic built-in Windows Disk Defragmenter makes sure that those
            applications are strategically positioned on the hard disk where
            they can be loaded into memory very quickly with the least physical
            movement of the hard disk's read-write heads.

            As part of the redesign of the networking architecture, IPv6 has
            been fully incorporated into the operating system and a number of
            performance improvements have been introduced, such as TCP window
            scaling. Earlier versions of Windows typically needed third-party
            wireless networking software to work properly, but this is not the
            case with Vista, which includes more comprehensive wireless
            networking support.
          </p>

          <p>
            For graphics, Vista introduces a new Windows Display Driver Model
            and a major revision to Direct3D. The new driver model facilitates
            the new Desktop Window Manager, which provides the tearing-free
            desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of Windows
            Aero. Direct3D 10, developed in conjunction with major graphics card
            manufacturers, is a new architecture with more advanced shader
            support, and allows the graphics processing unit to render more
            complex scenes without assistance from the CPU. It features improved
            load balancing between CPU and GPU and also optimizes data transfer
            between them. WDDM also provides video content playback that rivals
            typical consumer electronics devices. It does this by making it easy
            to connect to external monitors, providing for protected HD video
            playback, and increasing overall video playback quality. For the
            first time in Windows, graphics processing unit (GPU) multitasking
            is possible, enabling users to run more than one GPU-intensive
            application simultaneously.

            At the core of the operating system, many improvements have been
            made to the memory manager, process scheduler and I/O scheduler. The
            Heap Manager implements additional features such as integrity
            checking in order to improve robustness and defend against buffer
            overflow security exploits, although this comes at the price of
            breaking backward compatibility with some legacy applications. A
            Kernel Transaction Manager has been implemented that enables
            applications to work with the file system and Registry using atomic
            transaction operations.

            Improved security was a primary design goal for Vista. Microsoft's
            Trustworthy Computing initiative, which aims to improve public trust
            in its products, has had a direct effect on its development. This
            effort has resulted in a number of new security and safety features
            and an Evaluation Assurance Level rating of 4+.
          </p>

          <p>
            User Account Control, or UAC is perhaps the most significant and
            visible of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it
            possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by
            default, to stop malware from making unauthorized changes to the
            system. This was often difficult in previous versions of Windows, as
            the previous "limited" user accounts proved too restrictive and
            incompatible with a large proportion of application software, and
            even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar
            from the notification tray. In Windows Vista, when an action is
            performed that requires administrative rights (such as
            installing/uninstalling software or making system-wide configuration
            changes), the user is first prompted for an administrator name and
            password; in cases where the user is already an administrator, the
            user is still prompted to confirm the pending privileged action.
            Regular use of the computer such as running programs, printing, or
            surfing the Internet does not trigger UAC prompts. User Account
            Control asks for credentials in a Secure Desktop mode, in which the
            entire screen is dimmed, and only the authorization window is active
            and highlighted. The intent is to stop a malicious program from
            misleading the user by interfering with the authorization window,
            and to hint to the user about the importance of the prompt.
          </p>

          <p>
            Testing by Symantec Corporation has proven the effectiveness of UAC.
            Symantec used over 2,000 active malware samples, consisting of
            backdoors, keyloggers, rootkits, mass mailers, trojan horses,
            spyware, adware, and various other samples. Each was executed on a
            default Windows Vista installation within a standard user account.
            UAC effectively blocked over 50 percent of each threat, excluding
            rootkits. 5 percent or less of the malware that evaded UAC survived
            a reboot.

            Internet Explorer 7's new security and safety features include a
            phishing filter, IDN with anti-spoofing capabilities, and
            integration with system-wide parental controls. For added security,
            ActiveX controls are disabled by default. Also, Internet Explorer
            operates in a protected mode, which operates with lower permissions
            than the user and runs in isolation from other applications in the
            operating system, preventing it from accessing or modifying anything
            besides the Temporary Internet Files directory. Microsoft's
            anti-spyware product, Windows Defender, has been incorporated into
            Windows, protecting against malware and other threats. Changes to
            various system configuration settings (such as new auto-starting
            applications) are blocked unless the user gives consent.

            Whereas prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption
            using Encrypting File System, the Enterprise and Ultimate editions
            of Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption, which can protect
            entire volumes, notably the operating system volume. However,
            BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be
            permanently not encrypted and to contain system files for Windows to
            boot. In normal circumstances, the only time this partition is
            accessed is when the computer is booting, or when there is a Windows
            update that changes files in this area, which is a legitimate reason
            to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential
            security issue, because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe),
            or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level
            privileges would be able to write to this "Ghost Partition" and
            allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system, or
            disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a
            Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor (version 1.2) embedded
            in a computer's motherboard, or with a USB key. However, as with
            other full disk encryption technologies, BitLocker is vulnerable to
            a cold boot attack, especially where TPM is used as a key protector
            without a boot PIN being required too.
          </p>

          <p>
            A variety of other privilege-restriction techniques are also built
            into Vista. An example is the concept of "integrity levels" in user
            processes, whereby a process with a lower integrity level cannot
            interact with processes of a higher integrity level and cannot
            perform DLL–injection to processes of a higher integrity level. The
            security restrictions of Windows services are more fine-grained, so
            that services (especially those listening on the network) cannot
            interact with parts of the operating system they do not need to.
            Obfuscation techniques such as address space layout randomization
            are used to increase the amount of effort required of malware before
            successful infiltration of a system. Code integrity verifies that
            system binaries have not been tampered with by malicious code.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of the redesign of the network stack, Windows Firewall has
            been upgraded, with new support for filtering both incoming and
            outgoing traffic. Advanced packet filter rules can be created that
            can grant or deny communications to specific services.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 64-bit versions of Vista require that all new Kernel-Mode device
            drivers be digitally signed, so that the creator of the driver can
            be identified. This is also on par with one of the primary goals of
            Vista to move code out of kernel-mode into user-mode drivers, with
            another example being the new Windows Display Driver Model.

              The Windows Imaging Format (WIM) provides the cornerstone of
              Microsoft's new deployment and packaging system. WIM files, which
              contain a HAL-independent image of Windows Vista, can be
              maintained and patched without having to rebuild new images.
              Windows Images can be delivered via Systems Management Server or
              Business Desktop Deployment technologies. Images can be customized
              and configured with applications then deployed to corporate client
              personal computers using little to no touch by a system
              administrator. ImageX is the Microsoft tool used to create and
              customize images.

            Windows Vista includes a large number of new application programming
            interfaces. Chief among them is the inclusion of version 3.0 of the
            .NET Framework, which consists of a class library and Common
            Language Runtime. Version 3.0 includes four new major components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Windows Presentation Foundation is a user interface subsystem and
              framework based vector graphics, which makes use of 3D computer
              graphics hardware and Direct3D technologies. It provides the
              foundation for building applications and blending application UI,
              documents, and media content. It is the successor to Windows
              Forms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Communication Foundation is a service-oriented messaging
              subsystem that enables applications and systems to interoperate
              locally or remotely using Web services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows Workflow Foundation provides task automation and
              integrated transactions using workflows. It is the programming
              model, engine, and tools for building workflow-enabled
              applications on Windows.
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows CardSpace is a component that securely stores digital
              identities of a person, and provides a unified interface for
              choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as
              logging into a website.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These technologies are also available for Windows XP and Windows
            Server 2003 to facilitate their introduction to and usage by
            developers and end-users.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also significant new development APIs in the core of the
            operating system, notably the completely re-designed audio,
            networking, print, and video interfaces, major changes to the
            security infrastructure, improvements to the deployment and
            installation of applications ("ClickOnce" and Windows Installer
            4.0), new device driver development model ("Windows Driver
            Foundation"), Transactional NTFS, mobile computing API advancements
            (power management, Tablet PC Ink support, SideShow) and major
            updates to (or complete replacements of) many core subsystems such
            as Winlogon and CAPI.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are some issues for software developers using some of the
            graphics APIs in Vista. Games or programs built solely on the
            Windows Vista-exclusive version of DirectX, version 10, cannot work
            on prior versions of Windows, as DirectX 10 is not available for
            previous Windows versions. Also, games that require the features of
            D3D9Ex, the updated implementation of DirectX 9 in Windows Vista are
            also incompatible with previous Windows versions. According to a
            Microsoft blog, there are three choices for OpenGL implementation on
            Vista. An application can use the default implementation, which
            translates OpenGL calls into the Direct3D API and is frozen at
            OpenGL version 1.4, or an application can use an Installable Client
            Driver (ICD), which comes in two flavors: legacy and
            Vista-compatible. A legacy ICD disables the Desktop Window Manager,
            a Vista-compatible ICD takes advantage of a new API, and is fully
            compatible with the Desktop Window Manager. At least two primary
            vendors, ATI and NVIDIA provided full Vista-compatible ICDs.
            However, hardware overlay is not supported, because it is considered
            as an obsolete feature in Vista. ATI and NVIDIA strongly recommend
            using compositing desktop/Framebuffer Objects for same
            functionality.

          Windows Vista shipped in six different product editions. These were
          deviced across separate consumer and business target markets, with
          editions varying in features to cater to specific sub-markets. For
          consumers, there are three editions, with two available for
          economically more developed countries. Windows Vista Starter edition
          is aimed at low-powered computers with availability only in emerging
          markets. Windows Vista Home Basic is intended for budget users.
          Windows Vista Home Premium covers the majority of the consumer market
          and contains applications for creating and using multimedia; the home
          editions consequentally cannot join a Windows Server domain. For
          businesses, there are three editions as well. Windows Vista Business
          is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises, while
          Windows Vista Enterprise is only available to Software Assurance
          customers. Windows Vista Ultimate contains all features from the Home
          and Business editions, as well as Windows Ultimate Extras. In the
          European Union, Home Basic N and Business N variants without Windows
          Media Player are also available due to sanctions brought against
          Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws; similar sanctions exist in
          South Korea.

        <p>
          Windows Aero is the new graphical user interface, which Jim Allchin
          stated is an acronym for Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open.
          Microsoft intended the new interface to be cleaner and more
          aesthetically pleasing than those of previous Windows versions, and it
          features advanced visual effects such as blurred glass translucencies
          and dynamic glass reflections and smooth window animations. Laptop
          users report, however, that enabling Aero reduces battery life and
          reduces performance. Windows Aero requires a compositing window
          manager called Desktop Window Manager. It was a significant overhaul
          of the GUI, a bold and ambitious attempt to modernize the Windows user
          interface. It intoduced many new features, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Aero Glass: This was the most prominent feature of Windows Aero,
            giving windows a transluscent, glass-like appearance. It not only
            enhanced the visual appeal but also provided a sense of depth and
            layering, making the interface more intuitive to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flip 3D: This feature allowed users to cycle through open windows in
            a 3D stack, providing a visually engaging way to switch between
            tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Live Taskbar: The taskbar was redesigned to include thumbnails of
            open windows, making it easier to identify and switch between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Window Snap: This feature allowed users to easily resize and
            position windows on the screen by dragging them to the edges or
            corners of the display.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aero Peek: This feature temporarily minimized all open windows,
            giving users a clear view of the desktop.
          </li>
        </ul>

            A screenshot of Windows Vista. The UI has been completely overhauled
            <i>again</i>. The GUI is now new, fresh, beautiful, and makes the
            personal computers of its time almost useless with its weight on the
            CPU (and GPU if someone was rich enough).
