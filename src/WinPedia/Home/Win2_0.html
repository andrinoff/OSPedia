        Windows 2.0 is the second major release of the Microsoft Windows series
        of Operating Systems. It was released to manufaturing on December 9,
        1987. It refined the User Interface of Windows 1.0 and introduced
        multiple improvments.

        Windows 2.0 had 2 different variants: a base version for 8086 real mode
        (renamed to Windows/286 with the release of Windows 2.1) and
        Windows/386. The Operating System introduced new features such as
        overlapping windows, desktop icons, keyboard shortcuts, support for
        16-color VGA graphics, and Microsoft Word and Excel. The OS was noted as
        an improvement over its predecessor.
      </p>

        <p>
          The operating environment came in two different variants with
          different names and CPU support. The basic edition supported the
          virtual 8086 mode of the 80386 microprocessor. Despite its
          configuration, the variant was fully operational on an 8088 or 8086
          processor, although the high memory area would not be available on an
          8086-class processor, however, expanded memory could still be used.
          IBM's PS/2 Model 25 had an option to ship with a "DOS 4.00 and Windows
          kit" for educational markets, which shipped Windows with 8086
          hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other variant, named Windows/386, was available as early as
          September 1987, pre-dating the release of Windows 2.0 in December
          1987. It was much more advanced than the other variant. It introduced
          a protected mode kernel, above which the GUI and applications run as a
          virtual 8086 mode task.  The variant had fully preemptive
          multitasking, and allowed several MS-DOS programs to run in parallel
          in "virtual 8086" CPU mode, rather than always suspending background
          applications. With the exception of a few kilobytes of overhead, each
          DOS application could use any available low memory before Windows was
          started and users could run more applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Neither version worked with DOS memory managers like CEMM or QEMM or
          with DOS extenders, which have their own extended memory management
          and run in protected mode as well. This was remedied in version 3.0,
          which is compatible with Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) in
          "standard mode" and with DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) in "386
          enhanced" mode. Microsoft ended its support for Windows 2.0 on
          December 31, 2001.

          Unlike its predecessor, Windows 2.0 allows the user to overlap and
          resize application windows. It has also introduced desktop icons,
          keyboard shortcuts, and the terminology "minimize" and "maximize", as
          opposed to "iconize" and "zoom" which was used in Windows 1.0. Support
          for 16-color VGA graphics, EMS memory, and new capabilities of the
          i386 CPU in some versions were also added. Windows 2.0 is the last
          version of Windows that ran solely on floppy disks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The operating environment is shipped with fifteen programs, and it
          also introduced the GUI based programs Microsoft Word and Excel, to
          compete against the then-reigning competitors WordPerfect and Lotus
          1-2-3. Software such as the Aldus Pagemaker and CorelDRAW were also
          developed for Windows 2.0.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Windows API functions are largely handled by KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE,
          and GDI.EXE. These files along with device drivers, printer drivers
          being the exception, are combined by the Windows setup program into
          WIN200.BIN and WIN200.OVL. The system files WINOLDAP.MOD and
          WINOLDAP.GRB are used to run MS-DOS programs.
        </p>

        <p>
          IBM licensed Windows's GUI for OS/2 as Presentation Manager, and the
          two companies stated that it and Windows 2.0 would be almost
          identical.

        <p>
          Windows 2.0 introduced dialogue boxes which provided a standard way
          for users to interact with applications. Drop-down menus were
          introduced in Windows 2.0 which made it easier to access commands from
          within programs. The standard Window Controls now used the terms
          "minimize" and "maximize", instead of "iconize" and "zoom". There was
          little change to MS-DOS Executive, if any. The icons in the Program
          Manager (seperate from MS-DOS Executive) were further refined and were
          now more graphical and easier to recognize.
