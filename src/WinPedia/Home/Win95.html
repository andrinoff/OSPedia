      <p>
        Windows 95 is a consumer-oriented operating system developed by
        Microsoft and the first OS in the Windows 9x family of operating
        systems, released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995, and generally to
        retail on August 24, 1995. Windows 95 merged Microsoft's formerly
        separate MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows products, and featured significant
        improvements over its predecessor, most notably in the graphical user
        interface (GUI) and in its simplified "plug-and-play" features. There
        were also major changes made to the core components of the operating
        system, such as moving from a mainly cooperatively multitasked 16-bit
        architecture of its predecessor Windows 3.1 to a 32-bit preemptive
        multitasking architecture.

      <p>
        Windows 95 introduced multiple functions and features that are still an
        important component of the GUI in later Windows versions, which include
        the taskbar, notification area, and the Start button which summons the
        Start menu. Accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that
        generated a lot prerelease hype, it was a major success and is
        considered to be one of the biggest and most important products in the
        personal computing industry. Microsoft ended mainstream support for
        Windows 95 on December 31, 2000. Like Windows NT 3.51, which was
        released shortly before, Windows 95 received only one year of extended
        support, ending on December 31, 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most notable difference between Windows 95 and previous versions of
        Windows, as previously mentioned, was the Graphical User Interface. The
        User Interface was overhauled and and new elements were added such as
        the Start button, Start menu, the Desktop, and the taskbar. On clicking
        the Start button, the Start menu would pop up, from which you could
        launch programs. The taskbar held the Start button, running and pinned
        applications, and the system tray, which consisted of the time, volume
        and other icons.

        <summary class="level-one">Development History</summary>
        <p>
          The initial design and planning of Windows 95 can be traced back to
          around March 1992, just around the time before the release of Windows
          3.1. At this time, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT 3.1 were
          still in development. At this time, Microsoft's strategy was to have a
          next generation, high-end OS based on Windows NT, namely, Cairo, and a
          low-end, consumer-focused one as an evolution of Windows 3.1. The
          latter strategy was to develop a 32-bit underlying kernel and
          filesystem with 32-bit protected mode device drivers in Windows for
          Workgroups 3.11, however, although elements from the Cairo project
          eventually shipped in Windows NT 4.0 in late July 1996, without the
          object-based file system, which would later evolve into WinFS, to be
          used as the basis for the next version of Windows, code named
          "Chicago." Cairo would be Microsoft's next-generation operating system
          based on Windows NT, featuring a new user interface and an
          object-based file system, but it was not planned to be shipped before
          1994. Cairo would never be shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously with Windows 3.1's release, IBM started shipping OS/2
          2.0. Microsoft realized they required an updated version of Windows
          that could support 32-bit applications and preemptive multitasking,
          but could still run on low-end hardware (Windows NT did not).
          Initially, the "Chicago" team did not know how the product would be
          packaged. Initial thoughts were there might be two products, MS-DOS 7,
          which would just be the underlying OS, an evolution of the Windows for
          Workgroups 3.11 kernel, with a character mode OS on top, and a fully
          integrated graphical Windows OS. But soon into the project, the idea
          of MS-DOS 7 was abandoned and the decision was made to develop only an
          integrated graphical OS Windows "Chicago."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Windows 95's official release, users in the United States and
          United Kingdom had an opportunity to participate in the Windows 95
          Preview Program. For US$19.95/£19.95, users would receive several
          3.5-inch floppy disks that would be used to install Windows 95 either
          as an upgrade from Windows 3.1 or as a fresh installation.
          Participants were also given a free preview of The Microsoft Network
          (MSN), the online service that Microsoft launched with Windows 95.
          During the preview period, Microsoft established various electronic
          distribution points for promotional and technical documentation on
          Chicago, including a detailed document for media reviewers describing
          the new system highlights. The preview versions expired in November
          1995, after which the user would have to purchase their copy of the
          final version of Windows 95.

        <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
        <p>
          Windows 95 included support for 255-character mixed-case long
          filenames and preemptively multitasked protected-mode 32-bit
          applications. 16-bit processes were still co-operatively multitasked.
        </p>
        <span>Plug and Play</span>
        <p>
          Windows 95 tried to automate device detection and configuration as
          much as possible, but could still fall back to manual settings if
          necessary. During the initial install process of Windows 95, it would
          attempt to automatically detect all devices installed in the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows 95 also introduced the Device Manager to indicate which
          devices were working optimally with correct drivers and configuration
          and to allow the user to override automatic Plug and Play-based driver
          installation with manual options or give a choice of several
          semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices
          that still needed manual configuration. Windows 95 also has built-in
          support for Advanced Power Management.
        </p>

        <span>Long file names</span>
        <p>
          32-bit File Access is necessary for the long file names feature
          introduced with Windows 95 through the use of the VFAT file system
          extension. It is available to both Windows programs and MS-DOS
          programs started from Windows (they have to be adapted slightly, since
          accessing long file names requires using larger pathname buffers and
          hence different system calls). Competing DOS-compatible operating
          systems released before Windows 95 cannot see these names. Using older
          versions of DOS utilities to manipulate files means that the long
          names are not visible and are lost if files are moved or renamed and
          by the copy (but not the original) if the file is copied. During a
          Windows 95 automatic upgrade of an older Windows 3.1 system, DOS and
          third-party disk utilities which can destroy long file names are
          identified and made unavailable. When Windows 95 is started in DOS
          mode, e.g. for running DOS programs, low-level access to disks is
          locked out. In case the need arises to depend on disk utilities that
          do not recognize long file names, such as the MS-DOS 6.x's defrag
          utility, a program called LFNBACK for backup and restoration of long
          file names is provided on the CD-ROM, specifically in its
          \ADMIN\APPTOOLS\LFNBACK directory.
        </p>

        <span>32-bit</span>
        <p>
          Windows 95 followed Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with its lack of
          support for older, 16-bit x86 processors, thus requiring an Intel
          80386 (or compatible). While the OS kernel is 32-bit, much code
          (especially for the user interface) remained 16-bit for performance
          reasons as well as development time constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The introduction of 32-bit file access in Windows for Workgroups 3.11
          meant that 16-bit real mode MS-DOS is not used for managing the files
          while Windows is running, and the earlier introduction of the 32-bit
          disk access means that the PC BIOS is often no longer used for
          managing hard disks. DOS can be used for running old-style drivers for
          compatibility, but Microsoft discourages using them, as this prevents
          proper multitasking and impairs system stability. Control Panel allows
          a user to see which MS-DOS components are used by the system; optimal
          performance is achieved when they are bypassed. The Windows kernel
          uses MS-DOS style real-mode drivers in Safe Mode, which exists to
          allow a user to fix problems relating to loading native,
          protected-mode drivers.
        </p>
        <span>Core improvements in OEM Service Releases</span>
        <p>
          OEM Service Releases of Windows 95 introduced support in Windows for
          several core new technologies that were not included in the original
          release of Windows 95. These include the Internet Explorer web
          browser, DriveSpace compression, OpenGL, DirectX, FAT32 file system
          support, UltraDMA mode for disk drives, Universal Serial Bus, IEEE
          1394 (FireWire), and Accelerated Graphics Port.
        </p>

        <span>Accessibility features</span>
        <p>
          Windows 95 introduced computer accessibility features like Sticky
          keys, FilterKeys, ToggleKeys, Mouse keys. Microsoft Active
          Accessibility API was introduced as an add-on for Windows 95.

        <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
        <p>
          Several Windows 95 editions have been released. Only the original
          release was sold as a shrink-wrapped product; later editions were
          provided only to computer OEMs for installation on new PCs. For this
          reason, these editions are known as OEM Service Releases (OSR).
        </p>

        <p>
          Together with the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft released the
          Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 pack, which contained several optional
          components for high-end multimedia PCs, including Internet Explorer,
          DriveSpace and additional themes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first service pack was made available half a year after the
          original release and fixed several small bugs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second service pack mainly introduced support for new hardware,
          most notably support for hard drives larger than 2 GB in the form of
          the FAT32 file system. This release was never made available to
          end-users directly and was only sold through OEMs (OSR2) with the
          purchase of a new PC.
        </p>

        <p>
          A full third service pack was never released, but two smaller
          revisions to the second were released in the form of a USB Supplement
          (OSR2.1) and the Windows Desktop Update (OSR2.5). Both were made
          available as updated disc images shipped by OEMs, and the Windows
          Desktop Update was also released with the standalone Internet Explorer
          4.0 release. OSR2.5 was notable for featuring several changes to the
          Windows Explorer, integrating it with Internet Explorer 4.0—this
          version of Internet Explorer looks very similar to the one featured in
          Windows 98.
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
        <p>
          Windows 95 introduced a redesigned shell based around a desktop
          metaphor; File shortcuts (also known as shell links) were introduced
          and the desktop was re-purposed to hold shortcuts to applications,
          files and folders, reminiscent of Mac OS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Windows 3.1, the desktop was used to display icons of running
          applications. In Windows 95, the currently running applications were
          displayed as buttons on a taskbar across the bottom of the screen. The
          taskbar also contained a notification area used to display icons for
          background applications, a volume control and the current time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Start menu, invoked by clicking the "Start" button on the taskbar
          or by pressing the Windows key, was introduced as an additional means
          of launching applications or opening documents. While maintaining the
          program groups used by its predecessor Program Manager, it also
          displayed applications within cascading sub-menus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous File Manager program was replaced by Windows Explorer and
          the Explorer-based Control Panel and several other special folders
          were added such as My Computer, Dial-Up Networking, Recycle Bin,
          Network Neighborhood, My Documents, Recent documents, Fonts, Printers,
          and My Briefcase among others. AutoRun was introduced for CD drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user interface looked dramatically different from prior versions
          of Windows, but its design language did not have a special name like
          Metro, Aero or Fluent UI. Internally it was called "the new shell" and
          later simply "the shell". The subproject within Microsoft to develop
          the new shell was internally known as "Stimpy".
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1994, Microsoft designers Mark Malamud and Erik Gavriluk approached
          Brian Eno to compose music for the Windows 95 project. The result was
          the six-second start-up music-sound of the Windows 95 operating
          system, The Microsoft Sound and it was first released as a startup
          sound in May 1995 on Windows 95 May Test Release build 468.
        </p>
        <p>
          When released for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, Internet Explorer 4
          came with an optional Windows Desktop Update, which modified the shell
          to provide several additional updates to Windows Explorer, including a
          Quick Launch toolbar, and new features integrated with Internet
          Explorer, such as Active Desktop (which allowed Internet content to be
          displayed directly on the desktop).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the user interface elements introduced in Windows 95, such as
          the desktop, taskbar, Start menu and Windows Explorer file manager,
          remained fundamentally unchanged on future versions of Windows.
