    <p>
      Windows 1.0 was the first major version of the Microsoft Windows series of
      Operating Systems, released on November 20, 1985 for US and to European
      nations in May of 1986. It marked a significant step in the evolution of
      Personal Computers (PCs). It wasn't a full-fledged operating system; it
      was only a graphical shell that ran on top of MS-DOS (mentioned in Other
      Notable Versions of Windows, check it out after reading this). This
      approach introduced a user-friendly interface with icons and windows,
      compared to the command-line DOS-interface, which made computers more
      accessible to a wider audience.

      Development began when Bill Gates saw a demonstration of a similar piece
      of software, <b>Visi On</b> at COMDEX in 1982. Windows 1.0 runs on MS-DOS,
      as a 16-bit shell program known as MS-DOS Executive, and provides an
      environment which can run graphical programs designed for Windows as well
      as MS-DOS compatible programs. It included multi-tasking, the use of the
      mouse, and various built-in programs like Calculator, Paint, and Notepad,
      which can still be found today. It does not, however, allow its windows to
      overlap, rather the windows are tiled. Windows 1.0 had 4 releases 1.01
      through 1.04, adding support for more languages or newer hardware.

      <summary class="level-one">Development History</summary>
      <p>
        Microsoft showed its desire to develop a graphical user interface (GUI)
        as early as 1981. Development of Windows began after Bill Gates,
        co-founder of Microsoft as well as developer of Windows, saw a
        demonstration at COMDEX 1982 of VisiCorp's Visi On, a GUI software suite
        for IBM PC compatible computers. A year later, Microsoft learned that
        Apple's own GUI software—also bit-mapped, and based in part on research
        from Xerox PARC—was much more advanced. Microsoft decided it needed to
        differentiate its own offering. In August 1983, Gates recruited Scott A.
        McGregor, one of the key developers behind PARC's original windowing
        system, to be the developer team lead for Windows 1.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft first demonstrated a window manager to the press in September
        1983. The demonstration featured a user interface similar to Multiplan
        and other contemporary Microsoft applications with a command bar at the
        bottom of the screen. It also showed multiple application windows in
        both overlapping and tiled arrangements. This user interface concept was
        soon reworked to only support tiled windows and to change the
        Multiplan-like command bar into a menu bar under each window's title
        bar. The redesigned environment ultimately had its public debut at Fall
        COMDEX 1983 in November 1983. Initially requiring 192 KB of RAM and two
        floppy disk drives, Microsoft described the software as a device driver
        for MS-DOS 2.0. By supporting cooperative multitasking in tiled windows
        when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS system calls and
        permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen,
        Windows differed from both Visi On and Apple Computer's Lisa by
        immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows
        developers did not need to use Unix to develop IBM PC applications;
        Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including competitors,
        to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft user
        interface in their applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as Compaq, Zenith, and DEC
        promised to provide support, as did software companies such as
        Ashton-Tate and Lotus. After previewing Windows, BYTE magazine stated in
        December 1983 that it "seems to offer remarkable openness,
        reconfigurability, and transportability as well as modest hardware
        requirements and pricing … Barring a surprise product introduction from
        another company, Microsoft Windows will be the first large-scale test of
        the desktop metaphor in the hands of its intended users." From early in
        Windows's history, Gates viewed it as Microsoft's future. He told
        InfoWorld magazine in April 1984 that "our strategies and energies as a
        company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that we're
        committed to operating-system kernels like MS-DOS and Xenix. We're also
        saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be
        competitive in the long run." IBM was absent from Microsoft's
        announcement and rejected Windows in favor of creating its own product
        called TopView. By late 1984, the press reported a "War of the Windows"
        between Microsoft Windows, IBM's TopView, and Digital Research's
        Graphics Environment Manager (GEM). Steve Ballmer replaced McGregor
        after he left the team in January 1985.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 1983, Microsoft promised to ship Windows by April 1984. But
        due to multiple design modifications, its release date was delayed.
        During its development and before its windowing system was developed, it
        was briefly referred to by the codename "Interface Manager".
        De-emphasizing multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose,
        unlike that of TopView, was to "turn the computer into a graphics-rich
        environment" while using less memory. After Microsoft persuaded IBM that
        the latter needed a GUI, the two companies announced in April 1987 the
        introduction of OS/2 and its graphical OS/2 Presentation Manager, which
        were supposed to ultimately replace both MS-DOS and Windows.

        On November 20, 1985, the first retail release, Windows 1.01, was
        released in the United States at a cost of US$99 (equivalent to about
        $280.00 in 2023). In May 1986, the next release, 1.02, was published
        mainly for the European market, also introducing non-English versions of
        Windows 1.0. The version 1.03, released in August 1986, included
        enhancements that made it consistent with the international release like
        drivers for non-U.S. keyboards and additional screen and printer
        drivers, and superseded both version 1.01 in the US and version 1.02 in
        Europe. Version 1.04, released in April 1987, added support for the new
        IBM PS/2 computers, although no support for PS/2 mice or new VGA
        graphics modes was provided. However, on May 27, 1987, an OEM version
        was released by IBM, which added VGA support, PS/2 mouse support, MCGA
        support, and support for the 8514/A display driver. IBM released this
        version on three 3.5-inch 720k floppies and offered it as part of their
        "Personal Publishing System" and "Collegiate Kit" bundles. Microsoft
        ended its support for Windows 1.0 on December 31, 2001, making it the
        longest-supported version out of all versions of Windows.

        Windows 1.0 was built on the MS-DOS kernel, while it runs as a 16-bit
        shell program known as the MS-DOS Executive, and it offers limited
        multitasking of existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an
        interaction paradigm (cf. message loop), an execution model and a stable
        API for native programs for the future. The operating environment
        supports the use of a mouse, which allows users to perform
        click-and-drag operations. Contrary to modern Windows operating systems,
        the mouse button had to be kept pressed to display the selected menu.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opening .exe files in the MS-DOS Executive would open an application
        window. Windows 1.0 also includes programs such as the Calculator, Paint
        (then known as Paintbrush, only supported monochrome graphics), Notepad,
        Write, Terminal, and Clock. The operating environment also has the
        Cardfile manager, a Clipboard, and a Print Spooler program. Initially,
        Puzzle and Chess were supposed to appear as playable video games,
        although Microsoft scrapped the idea; instead, it introduced Reversi as
        a commercially published video game. It was included in Windows 1.0 as a
        built-in application, and it relies on mouse control. The operating
        environment also introduced the Control Panel, which was used to
        configure the features of Windows 1.0. The operating environment does
        not allow overlapping windows, and instead, the windows are tiled. When
        a program gets minimized, its icon would appear on a horizontal line at
        the bottom of the screen, which resembles the modern-day Windows
        taskbar.
      </p>

      <p>
        It consists of three dynamic-link libraries, which are located as files
        in the system under the names KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE. The
        Windows 1.0 SDK contains debugging versions of these files, which can be
        used to replace the corresponding files on the setup disks. The setup
        program combines multiple system files into one, so that Windows boots
        faster. Using the debugging KERNEL.EXE provided by the Windows 1.0 SDK
        one can create a "slow boot" version of Windows, where the files are
        separate. Windows 1.0 includes a kernel, which performs functions such
        as task handling, memory management, and input and output of files,
        while the two other dynamic-link libraries are the user interface and
        Graphics Device Interface. The operating environment could also move the
        program code and data segments in memory, to allow programs to share
        code and data that are located in dynamic-link libraries. Windows 1.0
        implemented the use of code segment swapping.
      </p>

      <p>
        Version 1.02 introduced drivers for European keyboards, as well as
        screen and print drivers. The last Windows 1.0 release, 1.04, introduced
        support for IBM PS/2 computers. Due to Microsoft's extensive support for
        backward compatibility, it is not only possible to execute Windows 1.0
        binary programs on current versions of Windows to a large extent but
        also to recompile their source code into an equally functional "modern"
        application with limited modifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        In March 2022, it was discovered that the operating environment also
        includes an easter egg that lists the developers who worked on the
        operating environment along with a message that says "Congrats!"

      <p>
        The GUI consisted of icons which could be clicked on to open files and
        programs. The desktop contained icons, windows in which programs ran,
        dropdown menus, and a line at the bottom that displayed running
        programs, similar to the modern-day taskbar on Windows. The Program
        Manager was unsophisticated, consisiting of a list of files that
        referred to a location on the disk. These could be programs, pictures,
        text files or other types of files. To change the wallpaper, system
        files had to be edited, which was very dangerous. Buttons were always in
        a pill shape, except for the control buttons like maximize and minimize,
        which were squares. Multitasking is cooperative, which means programs
        could not run at the same time. Instead, they take turns using the
        processor. Windows could not overlap, instead being tiled.
