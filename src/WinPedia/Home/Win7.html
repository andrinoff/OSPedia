        Windows 7 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system
        developed by Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on July 22,
        2009, and became generally available on October 22, 2009. It is the
        successor to Windows Vista, released nearly three years earlier. Windows
        7's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same
        time. It was succeeded by Windows 8 in October 2012.

        Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, over ten years after the
        release of Windows 7, after which the operating system ceased receiving
        further updates. A paid support program was available for enterprises,
        providing security updates for Windows 7 for up to three years after the
        official end of life. Windows 7 was intended to be an incremental
        upgrade to Microsoft Windows, addressing Windows Vista's poor critical
        reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility. Windows
        7 continued improvements on the Windows Aero user interface with the
        addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows pinned applications, and
        new window management features. Other new features were added to the
        operating system which included libraries, the new file-sharing system
        HomeGroup, and support for multitouch input. A new "Action Center" was
        added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance
        information, and the User Account Control system was slightly modified
        to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions
        of several stock applications, including Internet Explorer 8, Windows
        Media Player, and Windows Media Center.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike Windows Vista, Windows 7 received lots of praise, with critics
        considering the operating system to be a major improvement over its
        predecessor because of its improved performance, its more intuitive
        interface, fewer User Account Control popups, and other improvements
        made across the operating system. Windows 7 was a major success for
        Microsoft; even before its official release, pre-order sales for the
        operating system on the online retailer Amazon.com had surpassed
        previous records. In just six months, over 100 million copies had been
        sold worldwide, increasing to over 630 million licenses by July 2012. By
        January 2018, Windows 10 surpassed Windows 7 as the most popular version
        of Windows worldwide. Windows 11 overtook Windows 7 as the second most
        popular Windows version on all continents in August 2022. The legacy and
        impact of Windows 7 is still seen today. As of 2024, just 3% of
        traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 7, although it
        remains relatively popular in parts of the world, such as China (where
        it is tied with Windows 11), and is still second most popular in some
        countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 7 is the final version of Windows that supports processors
        without SSE2 or NX (although an update released in 2018 dropped support
        for non-SSE2 processors). Its successor, Windows 8, requires a processor
        with SSE2 and NX (for any then-supported architecture).

        <p>
          Originally, a version of Windows codenamed "Blackcomb" was planned as
          the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2000. Major
          features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on
          searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS
          to enable such scenarios. However, an interim, minor release,
          codenamed "Longhorn," was announced for 2003, delaying the development
          of Blackcomb. By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired
          some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb. After three
          major malware outbreaks—the Blaster, Nachi, and Sobig worms—exploited
          flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in
          August 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting
          some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while developing new
          service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of
          Longhorn (Windows Vista) was also restarted, and thus delayed, in
          August 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn. Blackcomb
          was renamed Vienna in early 2006, and was later canceled in 2007 due
          to the scope of the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          When released, Windows Vista was criticized for its long development
          time, performance issues, spotty compatibility with existing hardware
          and software at launch, changes affecting the compatibility of certain
          PC games, and unclear assurances by Microsoft that certain computers
          shipping with XP before launch would be "Vista Capable" (which led to
          a class-action lawsuit), among other critiques. As such, the adoption
          of Vista in comparison to XP remained somewhat low. In July 2007,
          following the shelving of the Vienna project and six months following
          the public release of Vista, it was reported that the next version of
          Windows would then be codenamed Windows 7, with plans for a final
          release within three years. Bill Gates, in an interview with Newsweek,
          suggested that Windows 7 would be more "user-centric". Gates later
          said that Windows 7 would also focus on performance improvements.
          Steven Sinofsky later expanded on this point, explaining in the
          Engineering Windows 7 blog that the company was using a variety of new
          tracing tools to measure the performance of many areas of the
          operating system on an ongoing basis, to help locate inefficient code
          paths and to help prevent performance regressions. Senior Vice
          President Bill Veghte stated that Windows Vista users migrating to
          Windows 7 would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they
          encountered migrating from Windows XP. An estimated 1,000 developers
          worked on Windows 7. These were broadly divided into "core operating
          system" and "Windows client experience", in turn organized into 25
          teams of around 40 developers on average.
        </p>

        <p>
          In October 2008, it was announced that Windows 7 would also be the
          official name of the operating system. There had been some confusion
          over naming the product Windows 7, while versioning it as 6.1 to
          indicate its similar build to Windows Vista and increase compatibility
          with applications that only check major version numbers, similar to
          Windows 2000 and Windows XP both having 5.x version numbers. The first
          external release to select Microsoft partners came in January 2008
          with Milestone 1, build 6519. Speaking about Windows 7 on October 16,
          2008, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confirmed compatibility between
          Windows Vista and Windows 7, indicating that Windows 7 would be a
          refined version of Windows Vista.
        </p>

        <p>
          At PDC 2008, Microsoft demonstrated Windows 7 with its reworked
          taskbar. On December 27, 2008, the Windows 7 Beta was leaked onto the
          Internet via BitTorrent. According to a performance test by ZDNet,
          Windows 7 Beta beat both Windows XP and Windows Vista in several key
          areas, including boot and shutdown time and working with files, such
          as loading documents. Other areas did not beat XP, including PC Pro
          benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing, which
          remain identical to Vista and slower than XP. On January 7, 2009, the
          x64 version of the Windows 7 Beta (build 7000) was leaked onto the
          web, with some torrents being infected with a trojan. At CES 2009,
          Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows 7 Beta, build 7000,
          had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet subscribers
          in the format of an ISO image. The stock wallpaper of the beta version
          contained a digital image of the Betta fish.
        </p>

        <p>
          The release candidate, build 7100, became available for MSDN and
          TechNet subscribers, and Connect Program participants on April 30,
          2009. On May 5, 2009, it became available to the general public,
          although it had also been leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent. The
          release candidate was available in five languages and expired on June
          1, 2010, with shutdowns every two hours starting March 1, 2010.
          Microsoft stated that Windows 7 would be released to the general
          public on October 22, 2009, less than three years after the launch of
          its predecessor. Microsoft released Windows 7 to MSDN and Technet
          subscribers on August 6, 2009. Microsoft announced that Windows 7,
          along with Windows Server 2008 R2, was released to manufacturing in
          the United States and Canada on July 22, 2009. Windows 7 build
          7600.16385.090713-1255, which was compiled on July 13, 2009, was
          declared the final RTM build after passing all Microsoft's tests
          internally.

        <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
        <p>
          Among Windows 7's new features are advances in touch and handwriting
          recognition, support for virtual hard disks, improved performance on
          multi-core processors, improved boot performance, DirectAccess, and
          kernel improvements. Windows 7 adds support for systems using multiple
          heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors (Heterogeneous
          Multi-adapter), a new version of Windows Media Center, a Gadget for
          Windows Media Center, improved media features, XPS Essentials Pack,
          and Windows PowerShell being included, and a redesigned Calculator
          with multiline capabilities including Programmer and Statistics modes
          along with unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and
          several others. Many new items have been added to the Control Panel,
          including ClearType Text Tuner, Display Color Calibration Wizard,
          Gadgets, Recovery, Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and
          Other Sensors, Credential Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons,
          and Display. Windows Security Center has been renamed to Action Center
          (Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds),
          which encompasses both security and maintenance of the computer.
          ReadyBoost on 32-bit editions now supports up to 256 gigabytes of
          extra allocation. Windows 7 also supports images in RAW image format
          through the addition of Windows Imaging Component-enabled image
          decoders, which enables raw image thumbnails, previewing and metadata
          display in Windows Explorer, plus full-size viewing and slideshows in
          Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Center. Windows 7 also has a
          native TFTP client with the ability to transfer files to or from a
          TFTP server.
        </p>

        <p>
          The taskbar has seen the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick
          Launch toolbar has been replaced with the ability to pin applications
          to the taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with
          the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy
          access to common tasks, and files frequently used with specific
          applications. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of
          taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small
          rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default,
          hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a
          quick look at the desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch
          screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in
          order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button
          minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Window management in Windows 7 has several new features: Aero Snap
          maximizes a window when it is dragged to the top, left, or right of
          the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen
          allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen,
          such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves
          windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores
          their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with
          keyboard shortcuts. Aero Shake hides all inactive windows when the
          active window's title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 7 includes 13 additional sound schemes, titled Afternoon,
          Calligraphy, Characters, Cityscape, Delta, Festival, Garden, Heritage,
          Landscape, Quirky, Raga, Savanna, and Sonata. Internet Spades,
          Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers, which were removed in
          Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. Users are able to disable
          or customize many more Windows components than was possible in Windows
          Vista. New additions to this list of components include Internet
          Explorer 8, Windows Media Player 12, Windows Media Center, Windows
          Search, and Windows Gadget Platform. A new version of Microsoft
          Virtual PC, newly renamed as Windows Virtual PC was made available for
          Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions. It allows
          multiple Windows environments, including Windows XP Mode, to run on
          the same machine. Windows XP Mode runs Windows XP in a virtual
          machine, and displays applications within separate windows on the
          Windows 7 desktop. Furthermore, Windows 7 supports the mounting of a
          virtual hard disk (VHD) as a normal data storage, and the bootloader
          delivered with Windows 7 can boot the Windows system from a VHD;
          however, this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate
          editions. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) of Windows 7 is also
          enhanced to support real-time multimedia application including video
          playback and 3D games, thus allowing use of DirectX 10 in remote
          desktop environments. The three application limit, previously present
          in the Windows Vista and Windows XP Starter Editions, has been removed
          from Windows 7. All editions include some new and improved features,
          such as Windows Search, Security features, and some features new to
          Windows 7, that originated within Vista. Optional BitLocker Drive
          Encryption is included with Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. Windows
          Defender is included; Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software
          is a free download. All editions include Shadow Copy, which—every day
          or so—System Restore uses (Shadow Copy) to take an automatic "previous
          version" snapshot of user files that have changed. Backup and restore
          have also been improved, and the Windows Recovery
          Environment—installed by default—replaces the optional Recovery
          Console of Windows XP.
        </p>

        <p>
          A new system known as "Libraries" was added for file management; users
          can aggregate files from multiple folders into a "Library." By
          default, libraries for categories such as Documents, Pictures, Music,
          and Video are created, consisting of the user's personal folder and
          the Public folder for each. The system is also used as part of a new
          home networking system known as HomeGroup; devices are added to the
          network with a password, and files and folders can be shared with all
          other devices in the HomeGroup, or with specific users. The default
          libraries, along with printers, are shared by default, but the
          personal folder is set to read-only access by other users, and the
          Public folder can be accessed by anyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 7 includes improved globalization support through a new
          Extended Linguistic Services API to provide multilingual support
          (particularly in Ultimate and Enterprise editions). Microsoft also
          implemented better support for solid-state drives, including the new
          TRIM command, and Windows 7 is able to identify a solid-state drive
          uniquely. Native support for USB 3.0 is not included because of delays
          in the finalization of the standard. At WinHEC 2008 Microsoft
          announced that color depths of 30-bit and 48-bit would be supported in
          Windows 7 along with the wide color gamut scRGB (which for HDMI 1.3
          can be converted and output as xvYCC). The video modes supported in
          Windows 7 are 16-bit sRGB, 24-bit sRGB, 30-bit sRGB, 30-bit with
          extended color gamut sRGB, and 48-bit scRGB.
        </p>

        <p>
          For developers, Windows 7 includes a new networking API with support
          for building SOAP-based web services in native code (as opposed to
          .NET-based WCF web services), new features to simplify development of
          installation packages and shorten application install times. Windows
          7, by default, generates fewer User Account Control (UAC) prompts
          because it allows digitally signed Windows components to gain elevated
          privileges without a prompt. Additionally, users can now adjust the
          level at which UAC operates using a sliding scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certain capabilities and programs that were a part of Windows Vista
          are no longer present or have been changed, resulting in the removal
          of certain functionalities; these include the classic Start Menu user
          interface, some taskbar features, Windows Explorer features, Windows
          Media Player features, Windows Ultimate Extras, Search button, and
          InkBall. Four applications bundled with Windows Vista—Windows Photo
          Gallery, Windows Movie Maker, Windows Calendar and Windows Mail—are
          not included with Windows 7 and were replaced by Windows Live-branded
          versions as part of the Windows Live Essentials suite.

        <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
        <p>
          Windows 7 is available in six different editions, of which the Home
          Premium, Professional, and Ultimate were available at retail in most
          countries, and as pre-loaded software on most new computers. Home
          Premium and Professional were aimed at home users and small businesses
          respectively, while Ultimate was aimed at enthusiasts. Each edition of
          Windows 7 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition
          below it, and adds additional features oriented towards their market
          segments; for example, Professional adds additional networking and
          security features such as Encrypting File System and the ability to
          join a domain. Ultimate contained a superset of the features from Home
          Premium and Professional, along with other advanced features oriented
          towards power users, such as BitLocker drive encryption; unlike
          Windows Vista, there were no "Ultimate Extras" add-ons created for
          Windows 7 Ultimate. Retail copies were available in "upgrade" and
          higher-cost "full" version licenses; "upgrade" licenses require an
          existing version of Windows to install, while "full" licenses can be
          installed on computers with no existing operating system.
        </p>

        <p>
          The remaining three editions were not available at retail, of which
          two were available exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded
          software. The Starter edition is a stripped-down version of Windows 7
          meant for low-cost devices such as netbooks. In comparison to Home
          Premium, Starter has reduced multimedia functionality, does not allow
          users to change their desktop wallpaper or theme, disables the "Aero
          Glass" theme, does not have support for multiple monitors, and can
          only address 2GB of RAM. Home Basic was sold only in emerging markets,
          and was positioned in between Home Premium and Starter. The highest
          edition, Enterprise, is functionally similar to Ultimate, but is only
          sold through volume licensing via Microsoft's Software Assurance
          program.
        </p>

        <p>
          All editions aside from Starter support both IA-32 and x86-64
          architectures, Starter only supports 32-bit systems. Retail copies of
          Windows 7 are distributed on two DVDs: one for the IA-32 version and
          the other for x86-64. OEM copies include one DVD, depending on the
          processor architecture licensed. The installation media for consumer
          versions of Windows 7 are identical, the product key and corresponding
          license determines the edition that is installed. The Windows Anytime
          Upgrade service can be used to purchase an upgrade that unlocks the
          functionality of a higher edition, such as going from Starter to Home
          Premium, and Home Premium to Ultimate. Most copies of Windows 7 only
          contained one license; in certain markets, a "Family Pack" version of
          Windows 7 Home Premium was also released for a limited time, which
          allowed upgrades on up to three computers. In certain regions, copies
          of Windows 7 were only sold in, and could only be activated in a
          designated region.

        <p>
          Windows 7 kept the Windows Aero theme, albeit with a few changes. Some
          of the lower editions like Starter and Home Basic did not support
          Windows Aero effects, as they were meant for low-end PCs which would
          be likely incapable of handling complex visual effects. The higher
          editions supported Windows Aero effects, but could be disabled if one
          prefers so. The taskbar was different from the the one in Windows
          Vista; it was redesigned so that one could pin applications to the
          taskbar for quick access, eliminating the need for the Quick Launch
          toolbar and therefore leading to its removal.

            A screenshot of Windows 7. The UI isn't too different, but it is not
            as heavy on the system because of its optimization and how hard
            companies worked to make better hardware that could run Windows
            Vista well without lagging.
