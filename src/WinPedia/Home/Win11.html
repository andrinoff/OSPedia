      <p>
        Windows 11 is the latest major release of Microsoft's Windows NT
        operating system, released on October 5, 2021. It succeeded Windows 10
        (2015), and is available for free for any Windows 10 devices that meet
        the new Windows 11 system requirements. Windows 11 features major
        changes to the Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows 10X,
        including a redesigned Start menu, the replacement of its "live tiles"
        with a separate "Widgets" panel on the taskbar, the ability to create
        tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the
        taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from Xbox
        Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on compatible
        hardware. Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced by the Chromium-based
        Microsoft Edge as the default web browser, like its predecessor, Windows
        10, and Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft
        also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be
        distributed via the Microsoft Store and to support Android apps on
        Windows 11.

      <p>
        Citing security considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11
        were increased over Windows 10; Microsoft only officially supports the
        operating system on devices using an eighth-generation Intel Core CPU or
        newer (with some minor exceptions), a second-generation AMD Ryzen CPU or
        newer, or a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 ARM system-on-chip or newer, with
        UEFI and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled.
        However, there are some exceptions to these requirements. While the OS
        can be installed on devices with unsupported configurations, Microsoft
        does not guarantee the availability of updates. Furthermore, Windows 11
        completely removes support for 32-bit CPUs, including both 32-bit x86
        and 32-bit ARM processors, ensuring compatibility only with 64-bit
        x86-64 and ARM64 processors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 11 received a mixed reception at launch. Pre-release coverage of
        the operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements, with
        discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the
        security of Windows, or as a ploy to upsell customers to newer devices,
        and over the e-waste associated with the changes. Upon release, it was
        praised for its improved visual design, window management, and stronger
        focus on security, but was criticized for various modifications to
        aspects of its user interface that were seen as worse than its
        predecessor; some were seen as an attempt to dissuade users from
        switching to competing applications. Additionally, some users have
        pointed out disadvantages such as the removal of features like the
        ability to move the taskbar and increased system requirements that may
        exclude older devices. As of November 2024, Windows 11, accounting for
        35% of Windows installations worldwide, is the second most popular
        Windows version in use, with its predecessor Windows 10 still being the
        most used version in virtually all countries (with Guyana being an
        exception, where Windows 11 is the most used), with it globally at over
        2 times the market share. Windows 11 has an estimated 23% share of all
        PCs (the rest being other Windows editions and other operating systems
        such as macOS and Linux), and an estimated 8.6% share of all devices
        (including mobile, tablet and console) are running Windows 11.

          In October 2019, Microsoft announced "Windows 10X", a future edition
          of Windows 10 designed exclusively for dual-touchscreen devices such
          as the then-upcoming Surface Neo. In May 2020, during the COVID-19
          pandemic, Panos Panay, Microsoft's chief product officer for Microsoft
          Windows and Microsoft Office, stated that "as we continue to put
          customers' needs at the forefront, we need to focus on meeting
          customers where they are now", and announced that Windows 10X would
          only launch on single-screen devices at first, and that Microsoft
          would "continue to look for the right moment, in conjunction with our
          OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market". In October
          2020, reports emerged that Microsoft was working on a user interface
          refresh for Windows 10 codenamed "Sun Valley", scheduled to be
          included in a late-2021 feature update codenamed "Cobalt". Internal
          documentation stated that the aim for "Sun Valley" was to
          "reinvigorate" the Windows user interface and make it more "fluid",
          with a more consistent application of WinUI, while reports suggested
          Microsoft planned to adapt UI elements seen in Windows 10X. In January
          2021, it was reported that a job listing referring to a "sweeping
          visual rejuvenation of Windows" had been posted by Microsoft. By
          December 2020, Microsoft had begun to implement and announce some of
          these visual changes and other new features on Windows 10 Insider
          Preview builds, such as new system icons, improvements to Task View to
          allow changing the wallpaper on each virtual desktop, x86-64 emulation
          on ARM, and adding the Auto HDR feature from Xbox Series X. On May 18,
          2021, Head of Windows Servicing and Delivery John Cable stated that
          Windows 10X had been canceled and that Microsoft would be
          "accelerating the integration of key foundational 10X technology into
          other parts of Windows and products at the company".

        <p>
          On June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was officially announced at a virtual
          event hosted by Chief Product Officer Panos Panay. According to
          Nadella, Windows 11 is "a re-imagining of the operating system".
          Further details for developers such as updates to the Microsoft Store,
          the new Windows App SDK (code-named "Project Reunion"), new Fluent
          Design guidelines, and more were discussed during another
          developer-focused event on the same day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Windows 11, the first major Windows release since 2015, builds upon
          its predecessor by revamping the user interface to follow Microsoft's
          new Fluent Design guidelines. The redesign, which focuses on ease of
          use and flexibility, comes alongside new productivity and social
          features and updates to security and accessibility, addressing some of
          the deficiencies of Windows 10. The Microsoft Store, which serves as a
          unified storefront for apps and other content, is also redesigned in
          Windows 11. The collaboration platform Microsoft Teams is integrated
          into the Windows 11 user interface, and is accessible via the taskbar.
          Microsoft claims performance improvements such as smaller update
          sizes, faster web browsing in "any browser", faster wake time from
          sleep mode, and faster Windows Hello authentication. Windows 11 ships
          with the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge web browser (for compatibility
          with Google Chrome web browser), and does not include or support
          Internet Explorer. Its rendering engine MSHTML (Trident) is still
          included with the operating system for backwards compatibility
          reasons, and Edge can be configured with Group Policy to render
          whitelisted websites in "IE Mode" (which still uses IE's rendering
          engine MSHTML, instead of Blink layout engine). Windows 11 is the
          first version of Windows since the original retail release of Windows
          95 to not ship with Internet Explorer. The updated Xbox app, along
          with the Auto HDR and DirectStorage technologies introduced by the
          Xbox Series X and Series S, will be integrated into Windows 11; the
          latter requiring a graphics card supporting DirectX 12 and an NVMe
          solid-state drive.

          The Microsoft Store, which serves as a unified storefront for apps and
          other content, is also redesigned in Windows 11. Microsoft now allows
          developers to distribute Win32, progressive web applications, and
          other packaging technologies in the Microsoft Store, alongside
          Universal Windows Platform apps. Microsoft also announced plans to
          allow third-party application stores (such as Epic Games Store) to
          distribute their clients on Microsoft Store. Windows 11 supports
          x86-64 software emulation on ARM-based platforms.

            On October 21, 2021, Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) became
            available to Beta channel builds of Windows 11 for users in the
            United States, which allows users to install and run Android apps on
            their devices. Users can install Android apps through any source
            using the APK file format. An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft
            Store is also available. The Windows Subsystem for Android and
            Amazon Appstore became available to Release channel users in the
            United States on February 15, 2022, in Windows 11 Release build
            22000.527. On March 5, 2024, Microsoft announced deprecation of WSA
            with support ending on March 5, 2025.
          </p>

          <p>
            WSA is based on the Intel Bridge runtime compiler; Intel stated that
            the technology is not dependent on its CPUs, and will also be
            supported on x86-64 and ARM CPUs from other vendors.

          <summary class="level-two">Setup</summary>
          <p>
            Home and Pro (since version 22H2) edition installation requires
            internet connection and Microsoft account login (only if for
            personal use on Pro) is mandatory unless manually bypassed to create
            a local user. However, Microsoft has since blocked one of the last
            remaining easy bypass methods that allowed local account creation
            during initial setup, complicating the bypass process further. All
            other editions are excluded from this requirement.

          <summary class="level-two">System security</summary>
          <p>
            As part of the minimum system requirements, Windows 11 only runs on
            devices with a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 security coprocessor,
            albeit with some exceptions, see System requirements for details.
            According to Microsoft, the TPM 2.0 coprocessor is a "critical
            building block" for protection against firmware and hardware
            attacks. In addition, Microsoft now requires devices with Windows 11
            to include virtualization-based security (VBS), hypervisor-protected
            code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot built-in and enabled by
            default. The operating system also features hardware-enforced stack
            protection for supported Intel and AMD processors for protection
            against zero-day exploits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like its predecessor, Windows 11 also supports multi-factor
            authentication and biometric authentication through Windows Hello.

          <summary class="level-two">Artificial intelligence</summary>
          <p>
            In subsequent updates, Microsoft added several features based on
            artificial intelligence (AI), like live captions, background noise
            removal in videoconferencing, webcam auto-framing that follows the
            user's movements, and AI-powered Bing Chat in the taskbar's search
            field. Following the integration of GPT-4 in Microsoft's other
            products, the company announced that by summer 2023, the newly
            released Microsoft Copilot would add GPT-4 integration to the
            Windows taskbar.
          </p>

          <p>
            On May 20, 2024, Microsoft officially announced Recall, a feature
            that uses a hardware AI accelerator to locally store snapshots of
            the user's activity (including content transcribed using live
            captions), and which allows users to search through them. This
            feature is exclusive to devices certified under the "Copilot+ PC"
            branding. Following pushback from the cyber security community,
            Microsoft delayed the feature in June 2024. A preview version will
            be added to the Microsoft Insider program at later date in order to
            test added security measures.

          Windows 11 is available in two main editions; the Home edition, which
          is intended for consumer users, and the Pro edition, which contains
          additional networking and security features (such as BitLocker), as
          well as the ability to join a domain. Windows 11 Home may be
          restricted by default to verified software obtained from Microsoft
          Store ("S Mode"). Windows 11 Home requires an Internet connection and
          a Microsoft account in order to complete first-time setup. This
          restriction is also applied to Windows 11 Pro since version 22H2 as it
          was announced in February 2022, although a Microsoft account isn't
          required if it's not for personal use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows 11 SE was announced on November 9, 2021, as an edition
          exclusively for low-end devices sold in the education market; it is
          intended as a successor to Windows 10 S, and also competes primarily
          with ChromeOS. It is designed to be managed via Microsoft Intune, and
          has changed based on feedback from educators to simplify the user
          interface and reduce "distractions", such as Snap Layouts not
          containing layouts for more than two applications at once, all
          applications opening maximized by default, and Widgets being removed.
          It is bundled with applications such as Microsoft Office for Microsoft
          365, Minecraft Education Edition, and Flipgrid, while OneDrive is used
          to save files by default. Windows 11 SE does not include Microsoft
          Store; third-party software is provisioned or installed by
          administrators. To target organizations migrating from Google Chrome,
          Microsoft Edge is configured by default to enable the installation of
          extensions from the Chrome Web Store. Other editions include Pro
          Education, Pro for Workstations, Education, Enterprise, Enterprise
          multi-session, IoT Enterprise, Enterprise LTSC, IoT Enterprise LTSC,
          Home Single Language, and Team; along with regional variations. These
          editions remain fundamentally the same as their Windows 10 edition
          counterparts. Two new editions called IoT Enterprise Subscription and
          IoT Enterprise Subscription LTSC have been introduced in version 24H2.

        <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
        <p>
          A redesigned user interface is present frequently throughout the
          operating system, building upon the Fluent Design System;
          translucency, shadows, a new color palette, and a rounded geometry are
          prevalent throughout the UI. A prevalent aspect of the design is an
          appearance known as "Mica", described as an "opaque, dynamic material
          that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background
          of long-lived windows such as apps and settings". Much of the
          interface and start menu takes heavy inspiration from the now-canceled
          Windows 10X. The Segoe UI font used since Windows Vista has been
          updated to a variable version, improving its ability to scale between
          different display resolutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The taskbar's buttons are center-aligned by default, and it is
          permanently pinned to the bottom edge of the screen; it cannot be
          moved to the top, left, or right edges of the screen as in previous
          versions of Windows without manual changes to the registry. The
          notifications sidebar is now accessed by clicking the date and time,
          with other Quick Actions toggles, as well as volume, brightness, and
          media playback controls, moved to a new settings pop-up displayed by
          clicking on the system tray. The "Widgets" button on the taskbar
          displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news aggregator with
          personalized stories and content (expanding upon the "news and
          interests" panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10). Microsoft
          Teams is similarly integrated with the taskbar, with a pop-up showing
          a list of recent conversations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Start menu has been significantly redesigned, replacing the "live
          tiles" used by Windows 8.x and 10 with a grid of "pinned"
          applications, and a list of recent applications and documents. File
          Explorer was updated to replace its ribbon toolbar with a more
          traditional toolbar, while its context menus have been redesigned to
          move some tasks (such as copy and paste) to a toolbar along the top of
          the menu, and hide other operations under an overflow menu.
        </p>

        <p>
          Task View, a feature introduced in Windows 10, features a refreshed
          design, and supports giving separate wallpapers to each virtual
          desktop. The window snapping functionality has been enhanced with two
          additional features; hovering over a window's maximize button displays
          pre-determined "Snap Layouts" for tiling multiple windows onto a
          display, and tiled arrangement of windows can be minimized and
          restored from the taskbar as a "snap group". When a display is
          disconnected in a multi-monitor configuration, the windows that were

            A screenshot of Windows 11. You can assume Microsoft loves
            reinventing the wheel. If you don't find the default UI candy for
            your eyes, you can't do anything about it. Or if you are desperate
            enough, you can look up how to. But it will neither be easy nor be
            100% safe as it has the ability to brick your system.
