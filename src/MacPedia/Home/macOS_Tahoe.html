    <p>
      macOS Tahoe (version 26) is the upcoming twenty-second major release of
      Apple's macOS operating system. The successor to macOS Sequoia (macOS 15),
      it was first announced at WWDC 2025 on June 9, 2025, with its first
      developer beta released the same day. In line with Apple's practice of
      naming macOS releases after landmarks in California, it is named after
      Tahoe, a lake straddling the border between California and Nevada.

      Tahoe will be the last version of macOS to support Macs with Intel
      processors, with support further-limited to selected iMac, MacBook Pro,
      and Mac Pro models; all future versions will only support Apple silicon.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Tahoe supports all Macs with Apple silicon and some of those with
        Intel's 9th generation Coffee Lake Refresh, 10th generation Ice Lake and
        Comet Lake, and Cascade Lake-based Xeon-W processors, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MacBook Air (M1, 2020) or later</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) or later</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) or later</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) or later</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (M1, 2020) or later</li>
        <li>iMac (2020) or later</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (2019) or later</li>
        <li>All Mac Studio models</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During its Platforms State of the Union event at WWDC 2025, Apple
        announced that macOS Tahoe will be the last version of macOS that
        supports Intel-based Macs. The only remaining Intel-based Macs supported
        by Tahoe are the Mac Pro (2019), the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), the
        MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) and the iMac
        (2020), thus ending support for Intel-based MacBook Air and Mac Mini
        models.

      <p>
        macOS Tahoe introduces several new features and improvements, mainly
        focused on the user interface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The UI has been completely redesigned for the first time since macOS
          Big Sur to use Liquid Glass, making it more consistent with Apple's
          other platforms, which also receive it. The menu bar is now fully
          transparent by default. The cursor has been redesigned, now having a
          more rounded appearance. App icons have been unified with iOS and
          iPadOS, and can have dark and tinted variants as introduced in iOS
          with iOS 18/iPadOS 18, as well as a new clear variant.
        </li>
        <li>Some system sound effects are refined.</li>
        <li>
          Folder icons have been redesigned and can now have custom colors,
          emblems, and emojis, and can also abide to the accent color. They also
          now have animations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spotlight Search has been redesigned and gains quick actions,
          "quick-key" shortcuts, menubar search, and Apple Intelligence
          integration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many iOS and iPadOS features have been brought over to the Mac, such
          as Live Activities and compact brightness/audio indicators.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Phone and Journal apps are now included as part of macOS. The
          Phone app uses Continuity to integrate with the iPhone.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Control Center has been redesigned, now functioning like and
          resembling the iOS version introduced in iOS 18/iPadOS 18.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Launchpad, introduced in OS X Lion and mostly unchanged
          afterwards, has been removed and replaced by the Applications feature
          which is similar to the App Library, used on iOS since iOS 14 and
          iPadOS since iPadOS 15. It is integrated into the Spotlight interface.
          iPhone apps also appear in the Applications list through Continuity
          from the user's iPhone, and will launch through iPhone Mirroring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Areas such as the Control Center, app opening and Spotlight Search now
          has increased animation.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Magnifier app, Vehicle Motion Cues, a system-wide Accessibility
          Reader, and support for Braille displays comes as part of expanded
          accessibility features.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some Lock Screen customisation features on iOS/iPadOS have been
          brought over to the Mac such as changing the color and font of the
          clock.
        </li>
        <li>Terminal gains support for 24-bit color and Powerline fonts.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Home only supports the redesigned architecture introduced with iOS 16
          and macOS Ventura and ends support for the legacy architecture.
        </li>
        <li>Support for FireWire 400/800 has been removed.</li>
      </ul>
