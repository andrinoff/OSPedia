    <p>
      Snow Leopard was publicly unveiled on June 8, 2009 at Apple's Worldwide
      Developers Conference. On August 28, 2009, it was released worldwide, and
      was made available for purchase from Apple's website and retail stores at
      the price of $29 USD for a single-user license. As a result of its low
      price, initial sales of Snow Leopard were significantly higher than those
      of its predecessors, with prices starting at $129 USD. The release of Snow
      Leopard came nearly two years after the launch of Mac OS X Leopard, the
      second longest time span between successive Mac OS X releases (the time
      span between Tiger and Leopard was the longest).
    </p>

    <p>
      The goals of Snow Leopard were improved performance, greater efficiency
      and the reduction of its overall memory footprint, unlike previous
      versions of Mac OS X which focused more on new features. Apple famously
      marketed Snow Leopard as having "zero new features". Its name signified
      its goal to be a refinement of the previous OS X version, Leopard. Much of
      the software in Mac OS X was extensively rewritten for this release in
      order to take full advantage of modern Macintosh hardware and software
      technologies (64-bit, Cocoa, etc.). New programming frameworks, such as
      OpenCL, were created, allowing software developers to use graphics cards
      in their applications. It was also the first Mac OS release since System
      7.1.1 to not support Macs using PowerPC processors, as Apple dropped
      support for them and focused on Intel-based products. As support for
      Rosetta was dropped in Mac OS X Lion, Snow Leopard is the last version of
      Mac OS X that is able to run PowerPC-only applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Snow Leopard was succeeded by OS X Lion (version 10.7) on July 20, 2011.
      For several years, Apple continued to sell Snow Leopard at its online
      store for the benefit of users that required Snow Leopard in order to
      upgrade to later versions of OS X. Snow Leopard was the last version of
      Mac OS X to be distributed primarily through optical disc, as all further
      releases were mainly distributed through the Mac App Store introduced in
      the Snow Leopard 10.6.6 update.
    </p>

    <p>
      Snow Leopard is the last version of Mac OS X that supports the 32-bit
      Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo CPUs. Because of this, Snow Leopard
      still remained somewhat popular alongside OS X Lion, despite its lack of
      continued support, mostly because of its ability to run PowerPC-based
      applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Snow Leopard is also the last release of Mac OS X to ship with a welcome
      video at first boot after installation.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Apple states the following basic Snow Leopard system requirements are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mac computer with an Intel processor (IA-32). "Yonah" processors such
          as Core Solo and Core Duo can run only 32-bit applications; later
          x86-64 architecture processors such as Core 2 Duo, Core i5 and i7 are
          also able to run 64-bit applications.
        </li>
        <li>Mac OS X 10.5.6 or later (10.5.8 is recommended)</li>
        <li>1 GB of RAM</li>
        <li>5 GB of free disk space</li>
        <li>
          DVD drive (also accessible via Remote Disc) or external USB or
          FireWire DVD drive for installation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Additional requirements to use certain features:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          QuickTime H.264 hardware acceleration support requires an Nvidia
          GeForce 9400M, 320M, or GT 330M graphics card.
        </li>
        <li>OpenCL requires a supported Nvidia or ATI graphics card.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Snow Leopard drops support for PowerPC-based Macs (e.g., Power Macs,
        PowerBooks, iBooks, iMacs (G4 and G5), all eMacs, plus pre-February 2006
        Mac Minis and the Power Mac G4 Cube), although PowerPC applications are
        supported via Rosetta, which is now an optional install. In 2020, two
        developer previews of Snow Leopard that are universal appeared on the
        Internet that can be booted on select G4 and G5 Power Macs with
        modification and patching.

    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">New or changed features</summary>
      <p>
        Mac OS X Snow Leopard is a release that refined the existing feature
        set, expanded the technological capabilities of the operating system,
        and improved application efficiency. Many of the changes involve how the
        system works in the background and are not intended to be seen by the
        user. For example, the Finder application was completely rewritten in
        the Cocoa application programming interface, from its previous Carbon
        codebase. Despite significant changes in the software, users will
        experience almost no changes in the user interface. Snow Leopard
        includes the following changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mac App Store – An app marketplace built in the image of the iOS App
          Store. Released in version 10.6.6.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boot Camp now allows Windows partitions to read and copy files from
          HFS+ partitions. The new version also adds support for advanced
          features on Cinema Displays and a new command-line version of the
          Startup Disk Control Panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Finder has been completely rewritten in Cocoa to take advantage of
          the new technologies introduced in Snow Leopard.
        </li>
        <li>
          A much smaller OS footprint, taking up about 7 GB less space than Mac
          OS X Leopard. Some of the recovered disk space (~250 MB) is because
          printer drivers are now downloaded or installed only as needed, rather
          than being pre-installed. The default install only contains those
          drivers needed for existing printers and a small subset of popular
          printers.
        </li>
        <li>
          iChat enhancements include greater resolution video chats in iChat
          Theater and lowered upload bandwidth requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Microsoft Exchange support is now integrated into the Mail, Address
          Book, and iCal applications. However, only Microsoft Exchange 2007 is
          supported and customers using prior versions of Exchange must either
          upgrade or use Microsoft Entourage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full multi-touch trackpad support has been added to notebooks prior to
          those introduced in October 2008. While the original MacBook Air and
          other early multi-touch trackpad enabled notebooks had support for
          some gestures, they were unable to use four-finger gestures. This
          limitation has now been removed in Snow Leopard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preview can infer the structure of a paragraph in a PDF document.
        </li>
        <li>
          QuickTime X (version 10), the next release of QuickTime player and
          multimedia framework, has been completely rewritten into a full 64-bit
          Cocoa application and builds on the media technologies in Mac OS X,
          such as Core Audio, Core Video, and Core Animation, to deliver
          playback. Apple has redesigned the QuickTime user interface to
          resemble the full-screen QuickTime view in prior versions, where the
          entire window displays the video. The titlebar and playback controls
          fade in and out as needed. QuickTime X also supports HTTP live
          streaming and takes advantage of ColorSync to provide high-quality
          color reproduction. If Snow Leopard is installed on a Mac with an
          nVidia GeForce 9400M, 320M or GT 330M graphics card, QuickTime X will
          be able to use its video-decoding capabilities to reduce CPU load.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safari 4 features Top Sites, Cover Flow, VoiceOver, expanded standards
          support, and built-in crash resistance, which prevents browser crashes
          caused by plug-ins by running them in separate processes. Safari 4 is
          bundled with Snow Leopard. Safari 4 is also available for free for Mac
          OS X Tiger, Leopard, and Windows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Time Machine connection establishment and backups are now much faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          VoiceOver has also been greatly enhanced in Snow Leopard. Reading of
          web pages is improved with Auto Web Spots — areas of a page
          automatically designated for quick access. On newer Apple portables,
          trackpad gestures can be used to control VoiceOver functions,
          including the "rotor" gesture first seen in VoiceOver for the iPhone
          3GS, allowing for the changing of certain VoiceOver navigation options
          by rotating fingers on the trackpad. Braille Display support is also
          improved, with Bluetooth displays supported for the first time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          AppleTalk, a network protocol suite that was introduced in 1985, is no
          longer supported. Apple Filing Protocol over TCP/IP is still supported
          in Snow Leopard.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is no longer possible to change an application's language using the
          Finder's "Get Info" dialogue. While there are workarounds for some
          applications, others (such as Adobe After Effects CS4) will not be
          able to be run in a different language than the one selected in the
          system without using Terminal commands or third-party software. The
          option to change language for individual apps was added back in macOS
          Catalina in 2019.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creator codes have had their priority in the application selection
          process reduced (Creator codes are per-file metadata attributes that
          define, for a file that has a creator code, what application should
          open that file, regardless of its extension).
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating or updating Hierarchical File System (HFS Plus predecessor)
          volumes is no longer supported.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <summary class="level-three">64-bit architecture</summary>
        <p>
          Mac OS X Tiger added limited support for 64-bit applications on
          machines with 64-bit processors; Leopard extended the support for
          64-bit applications to include applications using most of Mac OS X's
          libraries and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Snow Leopard, most built-in applications have been rebuilt to use
          the 64-bit x86-64 architecture (excluding iTunes, Front Row, Grapher
          and DVD Player applications). They will run in 32-bit mode on machines
          with 32-bit processors, and in 64-bit mode on machines with 64-bit
          processors.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the Mac OS X kernel has been rebuilt to run in 64-bit
          mode on some machines. On those machines, Snow Leopard supports up to
          16 terabytes of RAM. Newer Xserve and Mac Pro machines will run a
          64-bit kernel by default; newer iMac and MacBook Pro machines can run
          a 64-bit kernel, but will not do so by default. Users wishing to use
          the 64-bit kernel on those machines must hold down the numbers 6 and 4
          on the keyboard while booting to get the 64-bit kernel to load. A
          change to the com.apple.Boot.plist will also enable users with
          compatible computers to permanently boot into 64-bit for those wishing
          to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stuart Harris, software product marketing manager at Apple Australia,
          said, "For the most part, everything that they experience on the Mac,
          from the 64-bit point of view, the applications, the operating system,
          is all going to be 64-bit, but that at this stage there were very few
          things, such as device drivers, that required 64-bit mode at the
          kernel level".

        <summary class="level-three">Grand Central Dispatch</summary>
        <p>
          Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) uses the multiple processor cores now in
          every new Macintosh for more efficient performance. Due to the
          complexity of multithreaded programming and technical difficulties
          traditionally involved in making applications optimized for multicore
          CPUs, the majority of computer applications do not effectively use
          multiple processor cores. As a result, additional processing power,
          compared to single-core machines, often goes unused. Grand Central
          Dispatch includes APIs to help programmers efficiently use these cores
          for parallel programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Grand Central Dispatch abstracts the notion of threads away, and
          instead provides developers with the concept of queues—lists of jobs
          (blocks of code) that need to be executed. GCD takes the
          responsibility of distributing the jobs among actual threads and
          cores, and clearing up unused memory created by inactive or old
          threads to achieve maximum performance. Apple is also releasing APIs
          for Grand Central Dispatch for developers to use in their applications
          and also to analyze specific blocks of code running on Grand Central
          Dispatch.
        </p>

        <p>
          A new C and Objective-C language feature named "Blocks" facilitates
          creation of code that will easily optimize to take advantage of Grand
          Central Dispatch.

        <p>
          OpenCL (Open Computing Language) addresses the power of graphics
          processing units (GPUs) to leverage them in any application, and not
          just for graphics-intensive applications like 3D games. OpenCL
          automatically optimizes for the kind of graphics processor in the Mac,
          adjusting itself to the available processing power. OpenCL provides
          consistent numeric precision and accuracy, fixing a problem that has
          hampered GPU-based programming in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenCL includes a C-based programming language with a structure that
          is already familiar to Mac OS X programmers, who can use Xcode
          developer tools to adapt their programs to work with OpenCL. Only the
          most process intensive parts of the application need to be written in
          OpenCL C without affecting the rest of the code. OpenCL is an open
          standard that has been supported by AMD, Intel, and Nvidia; it is
          maintained by Khronos Group.
        </p>

        <p>
          It serves a similar purpose to Nvidia's C for CUDA and Microsoft's
          Direct3D 11 compute shaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          It only works with the following Mac GPUs: NVIDIA GeForce 320M, GT
          330M, 9400M, 9600M GT, 8600M GT, GT 120, GT 130, GTX 285, 8800 GT,

          6770M, HD 6970M. If the system does not possess one of these
          compatible GPUs, OpenCL code will instead execute on the system's CPU.

      <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
      <p>
        While the Finder was completely rewritten in Cocoa, it did not receive a
        major user interface overhaul. Instead, the interface has been modified
        in several areas to promote ease of use. These changes include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "traffic light" titlebar controls are now slightly lighter in
          appearance and have less depth than they did in Mac OS X 10.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exposé can now display windows for a single program by left clicking
          and holding its icon in the dock. Windows are arranged in a new grid
          pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contextual menus which come out of Dock icons now have more options
          and have a new look, with a semi-transparent charcoal background and
          white text.
        </li>
        <li>
          An option has been added to the Finder preferences that allows the
          user to modify search behavior. The default setting can be selected to
          (1) search the entire computer, (2) search only the current folder
          from which the search was initiated, or (3) perform the search based
          on the previously used scope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dock Stacks, when viewed as a grid, allow viewing of a subfolder as a
          new stack, rather than launching a Finder window, in a manner similar
          to "tunnelling". When viewed as grids or lists, scroll-bars are
          provided to navigate folders with more items than the current screen
          resolution will accommodate, as the program does not scale the icons
          to show as many as possible the way it did in OS X 10.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          The default gamma has been changed from 1.8 to 2.2 to better serve the
          color needs of digital content producers and consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows can now be minimized directly onto their application's icon in
          the dock.
        </li>
        <li>Faster PDF and JPEG icon refreshes.</li>
        <li>
          When searching for a network, the AirPort menu-bar icon animates until
          it finds a network and shows network strength of available networks in
          the drop down menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prefixes for bytes are now used in strictly decimal meaning (as
          opposed to their binary meaning) when describing disk space, such that
          an indicated file size of 1 MB corresponds to 1 million bytes, as
          commonly used by hard disk manufacturers.
        </li>
        <li>Snow Leopard shuts down and goes to sleep faster.</li>
        <li>New wallpapers</li>
        <li>
          As with most upgrades of Mac OS X, new wallpapers are available. There
          are new wallpapers in the Nature (two of which are of snow leopards),
          Plants and Black and White sub-folders under the Apple folder.
          Furthermore, there are new Apple wallpaper sub-folders with multiple
          wallpapers:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Art: Dancer on the Stage, Nighthawks, Poppies Blooming, A Sunday
            Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Suprematism, The Great
            Wave off Kanagawa, and Water Lilies.
          </li>
          <li>Patterns: Pinstripe and Saree.</li>
          <li>
            New solid colors can be used as wallpapers as well. There is a new
            blue and gray, as well as a solid kelp which serves as the "green
            wallpaper." The default "space nebula" wallpaper has been updated as
            well.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
