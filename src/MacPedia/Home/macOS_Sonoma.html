      macOS Sonoma (version 14) is the twentieth major release of macOS, Apple's
      operating system for Mac computers. The successor to macOS Ventura, it was
      announced at WWDC 2023 on June 5, 2023, and released on September 26,
      2023. It is named after the wine region located in California's Sonoma
      County.

    <p>
      macOS Sonoma was succeeded by macOS Sequoia, which was released on
      September 16, 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first developer beta was released on June 5, 2023, and macOS Sonoma
      entered public beta on July 11, 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sonoma is the final version of macOS that supports the 2018-2019 MacBook
      Air, as its successor, macOS Sequoia, drops support for those models.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Sonoma supports Macs with Apple silicon and Intel's Xeon-W and
        8th-generation Coffee Lake/Amber Lake chips or later, and drops support
        for various models released in 2017, officially marking the end of
        support for Macs without Retina display and the 12-inch MacBook. The
        2019 iMac is the only Sonoma-supported Intel Mac that lacks a T2 chip.
      </p>
      <p>Mac models that support macOS Sonoma are as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (2019 and later)</li>
        <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (2018 and later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (2018 and later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (2018 and later)</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (2019 and later)</li>
        <li>Mac Studio (all models)</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Unofficial support</span>
      <p>
        By using patch tools such as OpenCore Legacy Patcher, macOS Sonoma can
        be unofficially installed on earlier models that are officially
        unsupported. Such models date back to the 2008 MacBook Pro and 2007
        iMac.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to an Ars Technica analysis, 2016 and 2017 Macs received on
        average six years of updates, lower than the seven to eight years of
        updates received by Intel Macs released from 2009 to 2015.

      <summary class="level-one">New features and changes</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Sonoma includes a number of new features and improvements, mainly
        focused on productivity and creativity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Widgets have been revamped. They are no longer constrained to the
          Notification Center - instead they can be placed anywhere on the
          desktop, and the widget picker has been redesigned to resemble the iOS
          and iPadOS versions of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The lock screen has been redesigned to include a date and time similar
          to iOS and iPadOS. The power buttons have become a context menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Video-conferencing apps can overlay the presenter's webcam video on
          top of screen sharing.
        </li>
        <li>App icons have been made more rounded.</li>
        <li>
          The Spotlight search bar has been made more rounded, and its width has
          been decreased.
        </li>
        <li>Safari changes:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Browsing profiles enable separate sets of bookmarks, extensions, and
            cookies, which can be used to separate, for example, a personal
            setup from a work one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Password sharing lets multiple people have access to the same
            collection of website passwords, and update them as needed, with
            changes syncing across all enrolled devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Safari web apps let the user add any website to the Dock and open it
            in a simplified Safari interface, in a way that is similar to both
            web apps introduced in iPhone OS 1.1.3 and Google Chrome. This
            feature is slightly different from progressive web apps since it
            does not require additional work from website developers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Messages changes:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            More precise search filters: for example, the contact name can be
            combined with a search term to look for the term within a specific
            conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Catch-up lets the user quickly jump to the first unread message in a
            conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tapback now appears as multiple icons instead of being a context
            menu.
          </li>
          <li>iMessage stickers have a new selection interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Apple TV now has a sidebar instead of a top bar.</li>
        <li>
          Game mode optimizes gaming performance by prioritizing gaming tasks
          and allocating more GPU and CPU capacity to the game. It provides
          smoother frame rates for game play and reduced latency for Bluetooth
          peripherals, such as wireless game controllers and AirPods.
        </li>
        <li>
          New slow-motion screensavers of different locations worldwide. When
          logged in, they gradually slow down and become the desktop wallpaper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Smoother animations for several areas such as the notification panel,
          the lock screen, and the show desktop gesture. The notifications now
          slide in with an ease-out motion, the lock screen now zooms in and out
          when unlocking and locking, the show desktop gesture has a new spring
          back animation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can react with their hands and animations will pop up based on
          the hand gesture.
        </li>
        <li>
          AV1 hardware decoding has been introduced on devices with AV1 hardware
          decoding support, such as Macs with SoCs from the Apple M3 family.
        </li>
        <li>
          Print Center, a utility application returning from Mac OS X Tiger, was
          reintroduced for managing print jobs, viewing different printer
          queues, and pausing or deleting print jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
          The text cursor now looks more like its iOS counterpart. It is bolder,
          has a smooth blinking motion, and its color follows the current app's
          accent color. It also briefly displays an indicator that shows the
          current input language when the user switches keyboard languages. This
          indicator can also signal helpful input details like when Caps Lock is
          on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Videos now encode faster in Final Cut Pro, Compressor, and third-party
          video applications on Mac computers using M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra.
        </li>
        <li>
          The startup screen is now slightly different, with the loading bar at
          the bottom being lowered to the bottom of the screen instead of
          immediately under the Apple logo.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Gaming</span>
      <p>
        Alongside macOS Sonoma, Apple announced developer tools for porting
        Windows games to macOS. The Game Porting Toolkit (GPTK), derived from
        Wine and Crossover and released in beta, translates Windows application
        programming interface (API) calls to equivalent macOS APIs, allowing
        developers to run unmodified versions of their x86 Windows DirectX games
        on macOS. Mac users have been able to use the Game Porting Toolkit to
        run a number of DirectX 12 games; tech news outlets have compared the
        tool to Valve Corporation's Proton compatibility layer for Linux. Apple
        also released a Metal Shader Converter that converts shaders to Apple's
        Metal graphics API.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DigitalFoundry review of the first beta of Game Porting Toolkit found
        it "impressive", with few graphical glitches and full support for
        console controllers instead of the keyboard, though they found that
        frame rates were around half of what they would be on Windows, and that
        many games were not supported. During the Sonoma beta, updates to the
        Game Porting Toolkit brought support for 32-bit games and around 20%
        better performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing for AppleInsider and iMore, reporter Peter Cohen said that Game
        Mode and the Game Porting Toolkit are improvements but do not indicate
        the kind of "sea change" in Apple's priorities and culture that are
        needed to build a true Mac gaming ecosystem. Cohen says that the problem
        with Mac gaming is not in the ability to port games, but in a lack of a
        "business case" for game publishers to do so, due to the Mac's low
        market share, the cost of supporting a port, and uncertain demand for
        Mac games when many Mac users also own consoles or gaming PCs. YouTuber
        Snazzy Labs issued similar criticisms, which journalist John Siracusa
        agreed with.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two">New Unicode Characters Font Support</span>
      <p>macOS 14.0 introduced support for the following Unicode characters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tagalog Letter Ra (U+170D) (14.0)</li>
        <li>Tagalog Sign Pamudpod (U+1715) (14.0)</li>
        <li>Tagalog Letter Archaic Ra (U+171F) (14.0)</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for legacy Mail plug-ins has been removed.</li>
        <li>
          System API support for converting PostScript and Encapsulated
          PostScript files to PDF format has been removed, following previous
          changes in macOS Ventura that removed support for viewing and
          converting PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript files within
          Preview.
