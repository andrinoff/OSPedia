    <p>
      Mac OS X Leopard (version 10.5) is the sixth major release of macOS,
      Apple's desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers.
      Leopard was released on October 26, 2007 as the successor of Mac OS X
      Tiger, and is available in two editions: a desktop version suitable for
      personal computers, and a server version, Mac OS X Server. It retailed for
      $129 for the desktop version and $499 for Server. Leopard was superseded
      by Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) in 2009. Mac OS X Leopard is the
      last version of macOS that supports the PowerPC architecture as its
      successor, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, functions solely on Intel based Macs.

      According to Apple, Leopard contains over 300 changes and enhancements
      compared to its predecessor, Mac OS X Tiger, covering core operating
      system components as well as included applications and developer tools.
      Leopard introduces a significantly revised desktop, with a redesigned
      Dock, Stacks, a semitransparent menu bar, and an updated Finder that
      incorporates the Cover Flow visual navigation interface first seen in
      iTunes. Other notable features include support for writing 64-bit
      graphical user interface applications, an automated backup utility called
      Time Machine, support for Spotlight searches across multiple machines, and
      the inclusion of Front Row and Photo Booth, which were previously included
      with only some Mac models.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apple missed Leopard's release time frame as originally announced by
      Apple's CEO Steve Jobs. When first discussed in June 2005, Jobs had stated
      that Apple intended to release Leopard at the end of 2006 or early 2007. A
      year later, this was amended to Spring 2007; however, on April 12, 2007,
      Apple issued a statement that its release would be delayed until October
      2007 because of the development of the iPhone.

      Mac OS X Leopard is the first version of Mac OS X to run on the MacBook
      Air.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Apple states the following basic Leopard system requirements, although,
        for some specific applications and features (such as iChat backdrops) an
        Intel processor is required:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Processor: any Intel processor, or PowerPC G5 or G4 (867 MHz and
          faster) processor
        </li>
        <li>
          Optical drive: internal or external DVD drive (for installation of the
          operating system)
        </li>
        <li>
          Memory: minimum 512 MB of RAM (additional RAM (1 GB) is recommended
          for development purposes)
        </li>
        <li>Hard drive capacity: Minimum 9 GB of disk space available.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Leopard’s retail version was not released in separate versions for each
        type of processor, but instead consisted of one universal release that
        could run on both PowerPC and Intel processors. However, the install
        discs that ship with Intel-based Macs only contain Intel binaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Processor type and speed are checked during installation and
        installation halted if insufficient; however, Leopard will run on slower
        G4 processor machines (e.g., a 733 MHz Quicksilver) if the installation
        is performed on a supported Mac and its hard drive then moved to a
        slower/unsupported one (the drive may either be an internal mechanism or
        a Firewire external).
      </p>

      <div class="div-level-two">
        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Supported machines</summary>
          <p>
            Mac OS X Leopard can run on the later flat-panel iMac G4s, the iMac
            G5, iMac Intel Core Duo and iMac Intel Core 2 Duo, PowerBook G4,
            Power Mac G4, Power Mac G5, iBook G4, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook
            Air, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Xserve, Xserve G5, Xserve RAID, Macintosh
            Server G4, and later eMac models. Leopard can run on older hardware
            as long as they have a G4 upgrade installed running at the 867 MHz
            or faster, have at least 9 GB free of hard drive space, 512 MB RAM
            and have a DVD drive. Leopard however will not run on the 900 MHz
            iBook G3 models even though they exceed the minimum 867 MHz
            requirement. This is due to the lack of AltiVec support in the G3
            line of processors. Leopard can be "hacked" (see below) to install
            on these G3 and pre-867 MHz G4 machines but the system may behave
            erratically and many of the programs, features, and functions may
            not work properly or at all. As of mid-2010, some Apple computers
            have firmware factory installed which will no longer allow
            installation of Mac OS X Leopard. These computers only allow
            installation of Mac OS X Snow Leopard. However, some computers (such
            as the 2011 model of the Mac mini) can have Leopard installed on
            them without hacking.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary class="level-two">Usage on unsupported hardware</summary>
          <p>
            Some ways of running Leopard on certain unsupported hardware,
            primarily PowerPC G4 computers with CPU speeds lower than the
            official requirement of 867 MHz, have been discovered. A common way
            is use of the program LeopardAssist, which is a bootloader similar
            in some respects to XPostFacto (used for installing earlier releases
            of Mac OS X on unsupported G3 and pre-G3 Macs) that uses the Mac’s
            Open Firmware to tell Leopard that the machine does have a CPU
            meeting the 867 MHz minimum requirement that the Installer checks
            for before installation is allowed to commence, when in reality the
            CPU is slower. Currently, LeopardAssist only runs on slower G4s and
            many people have installed Leopard successfully on these older
            machines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users who have access to supported hardware have installed Leopard
            on the supported machine then simply moved the hard drive to the
            unsupported machine. Alternatively, the Leopard Installation DVD was
            booted on a supported Mac, then installed on an unsupported Mac via
            Firewire Target Disk Mode. Leopard is only compiled for
            AltiVec-enabled PowerPC processors (G4 and G5) though, as well as
            Intel, so both of these methods will only work on Macs with G4 or
            later CPUs. While some of the earlier beta releases were made to run
            on some later G3 machines (mostly later 800–900 MHz iBooks), no
            success with the retail version has been officially reported on G3
            Macs except for some later iMacs and "Pismo" PowerBook G3s with G4
            processor upgrades installed.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a number of months after Leopard's release it appeared that the
            only G3 Macs on which Leopard could be run were those with both an
            aftermarket G4 processor and an AGP graphics card, as failures with
            the OS partially booting before crashing were reported on older Macs
            such as the original tray-loading iMacs and the Beige and Blue &amp
            White Power Mac G3 (all with G4 upgrades as Leopard will not even
            begin to load without one) whereas it would boot fine on newer Macs
            where the Installer restriction had been circumvented. However, more
            recently it has been reported that with some more work and use of
            kernel extensions from XPostFacto, Tiger and beta builds of Leopard,
            the OS can be made to run on G4-upgraded Macs as old as the Power
            Macintosh 9500, despite the lack of AGP-based graphics. While
            Leopard can be run on any Mac with a G4 or later processor, some
            functionality such as Front Row or Time Machine fails to work
            without a Quartz Extreme-capable graphics card, which many of the
            earlier G4s did not include in their factory specification.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Apple moved to using Intel processors in their computers, the
            OSx86 community has developed and now also allows Mac OS X Tiger and
            later releases to be installed and run successfully on non-Apple
            x86-based computers, albeit in violation of Apple's licensing
            agreement for Mac OS X.

            Apple advertised that Mac OS X Leopard has 300+ new features,
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A new and improved Automator, with easy starting points to easily
              start a workflow. It also can quickly create or edit workflows
              with new interface improvements. Now it can use a new action
              called "Watch Me Do" that lets users record a user action (like
              pressing a button or controlling an application without built-in
              Automator support) and replay as an action in a workflow. It can
              create more useful Automator workflows with actions for RSS feeds,
              iSight camera video snapshots, PDF manipulation, and much more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Back to My Mac, a feature for MobileMe users that allows users to
              access files on their home computer while away from home via the
              internet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boot Camp, a software assistant allowing for the installation of
              other operating systems, such as Windows XP (SP2 or later) or
              Windows Vista, on a separate partition (or separate internal
              drive) on Intel-based Macs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dashboard enhancements, including Web Clip, a feature that allows
              users to turn a part of any Web page displayed in Safari into a
              live Dashboard widget, and Dashcode to help developers code
              widgets.
            </li>
            <li>
              New Desktop, comprises a redesigned 3-D dock with a new grouping
              feature called Stacks, which displays files in either a "fan"
              style, "grid" style, or (since 10.5.2) a "list" style. Rory Prior,
              on the ThinkMac blog, criticized the shelf-like Dock along with a
              number of other changes to the user interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dictionary can now search Wikipedia, and a dictionary of Apple
              terminology as well. Also included is the Japanese-language
              dictionary Daijisen, Progressive E-J and Progressive J-E
              dictionaries, and the 25,000-word thesaurus Tsukaikata no Wakaru
              Ruigo Reikai Jiten, all of which are provided by the Japanese
              publisher Shogakukan.
            </li>
            <li>
              A redesigned Finder, with features similar to those seen in iTunes
              7, including Cover Flow and a Source list-like sidebar.
            </li>
            <li>
              Front Row has been reworked to closely resemble the interface of
              the original Apple TV.
            </li>
            <li>
              iCal calendar sharing and group scheduling as well as syncing
              event invitations from Mail. The icon also reflects the current
              date even when the application is not running. In previous
              versions of Mac OS X, the icon would show July 17 in the icon any
              time the application was not running but the current date when the
              application was running.
            </li>
            <li>
              iChat enhancements, including multiple logins, invisibility,
              animated icons, and tabbed chats, similar to features present in
              Pidgin, Adium and the iChat plugin Chax; iChat Theater, allowing
              users to incorporate images from iPhoto, presentations from
              Keynote, videos from QuickTime, and other Quick Look features into
              video chats; and Backdrops, which are similar to chroma keys, but
              use a real-time difference matte technique which does not require
              a green or blue screen. iChat also implements screen sharing, a
              feature previously available with Apple Remote Desktop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mail enhancements including the additions of RSS feeds,
              Stationery, Notes, and to-dos. To-dos use a system-wide service
              that is available to all applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Network file sharing improvements include more granular control
              over permissions, consolidation of AFP, FTP and SMB sharing into
              one control panel, and the ability to share individual folders, a
              feature that had not been available since Mac OS 9.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parental controls now include the ability to place restrictions on
              use of the Internet and to set parental controls from anywhere
              using remote setup.
            </li>
            <li>
              Photo Booth enhancements, including video recording with real-time
              filters and blue/green-screen technology.
            </li>
            <li>
              Podcast Capture, an application allowing users to record and
              distribute podcasts. It requires access to a computer running Mac
              OS X Server with Podcast Producer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preview adds support for annotation, graphics, extraction, search,
              markup, Instant Alpha and size adjustment tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quick Look, a framework allowing documents to be viewed without
              opening them in an external application and can preview it in full
              screen. Plug-ins are available for Quick Look so that users can
              also view other files, such as Installer Packages.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Finder, showing files in Cover Flow View and viewing a file
              using Quick Look
            </li>
            <li>Safari 3, which includes Web Clip.</li>
            <li>
              Spaces, an implementation of virtual desktops (individually called
              "Spaces"), allows multiple desktops per user, with certain
              applications and windows in each desktop. Users can organize
              certain Spaces for certain applications (e.g., one for
              work-related tasks and one for entertainment) and switch between
              them. Exposé works inside Spaces, allowing the user to see at a
              glance all desktops on one screen.) Users can create and control
              up to 16 spaces, and applications can be switched between each
              one, creating a very large workspace. The auto-switching feature
              in Spaces has annoyed some of its users. Apple added a new
              preference in 10.5.2 which disabled this feature, but there were
              still bugs found while switching windows. In 10.5.3, this problem
              was addressed and was no longer an issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as
              Boolean operators, as well as the ability to search other
              computers (with appropriate permissions).
            </li>
            <li>
              Time Machine, an automated backup utility which allows the user to
              restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another
              version of a file. Though generally lauded in the press as a step
              forward for data recovery, Time Machine has been criticized in
              multiple publications for lacking the capabilities of third-party
              backup software. Analyzing the feature for TidBITS, Joe Kissell
              pointed out that Time Machine does not create bootable copies of
              backed-up volumes, does not back up to AirPort Disk hard drives
              and will not back up FileVault encrypted home directories until
              the user logs out, concluding that the feature is "pretty good at
              what it does" but he will only use it as part of a "broader backup
              strategy". One of these issues has been resolved, however; On
              March 19, 2008, updates were released for AirPort and Time
              Machine, allowing for Time Machine to use a USB hard disk which
              has been connected to an AirPort Extreme Base Station.
            </li>
            <li>
              Universal Access enhancements: significant improvements to
              applications including VoiceOver, along with increased support for
              Braille, closed captioning and a new high‐quality Speech synthesis
              voice.

              Native support by many libraries and frameworks for 64-bit
              applications, allowing 64-bit Cocoa applications. Existing 32-bit
              applications using those libraries and frameworks should continue
              to run without the need for emulation or translation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leopard offers the Objective-C 2.0 runtime, which includes new
              features such as garbage collection. Xcode 3.0 supports the
              updated language and was itself rewritten with it.
            </li>
            <li>
              A new framework, Core Animation, allows a developer to create
              complex animations while specifying only a "start" and a "goal"
              space. The main goal of Core Animation is to enable the creation
              of complex animations with small amounts of program code.

            <li>
              Apple integrates DTrace from the OpenSolaris project and adds a
              graphical interface called Instruments (previously Xray). DTrace
              provides tools that users, administrators and developers can use
              to tune the performance of the operating system and the
              applications that run on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The new Scripting Bridge allows programmers to use Python 2.5 and
              Ruby 1.8.6 to interface with the Cocoa frameworks.
            </li>
            <li>Ruby on Rails is included in the default install.</li>
            <li>
              Leopard’s OpenGL stack has been updated to version 2.1, and uses
              LLVM to increase its vertex processing speed. Apple has been
              working to get LLVM integrated into GCC; LLVM’s use within other
              operating system facilities has not been announced.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Graphics and Media State of the Union address confirmed many
              other features are possible because of Core Animation, such as
              live desktops, improvements to Quartz Composer with custom
              patches, a new PDF Kit for developers, and improvements to
              QuickTime APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The FSEvents framework allows applications to register for
              notifications of changes to a given directory tree.

            <li>
              Leopard includes a read-only implementation of the ZFS file
              system.<br />
              In mid-December 2006, a pre-release version of Leopard appeared to
              include support for Sun’s ZFS. Jonathan Schwartz, CEO and
              President of Sun Microsystems, boasted on June 6, 2007, that ZFS
              had become "the file system" for Leopard. However, the senior
              project marketing director for Mac OS X stated on June 11, 2007,
              that the existing HFS+, not ZFS, would be used in Leopard. Apple
              later clarified that a read-only version of ZFS would be included.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leopard includes drivers for UDF 2.5, necessary for reading HD DVD
              and Blu-ray discs using third-party drives, but the included DVD
              Player software can only play HD DVDs authored by DVD Studio Pro.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leopard includes a framework implementing latent semantic mapping
              for classifying (e.g. textual) data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leopard is the first operating system with open-source BSD code to
              be certified as fully UNIX-compliant. Certification means that
              software following the Single UNIX Specification can be compiled
              and run on Leopard without the need for any code modification. The
              certification only applies to Leopard when run on Intel
              processors.
            </li>
            <li>Leopard includes J2SE 5.0.</li>

          <summary class="level-two">Security enhancements</summary>
          <p>
            New security features intend to provide better internal resiliency
            to successful attacks, in addition to preventing attacks from being
            successful in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leopard implements library randomization, which randomizes the
            locations of some libraries in memory. Vulnerabilities that corrupt
            program memory often rely on known addresses for these library
            routines, which allow injected code to launch processes or change
            files. Library randomization is presumably a stepping-stone to a
            more complete implementation of address space layout randomization
            at a later date.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="level-three">Application Layer Firewall</span>
              <p>
                Leopard ships with two firewall engines: the original BSD IPFW,
                which was present in earlier releases of Mac OS X, and the new
                Leopard Application Layer Firewall. Unlike IPFW, which
                intercepts and filters IP datagrams before the kernel performs
                significant processing, the Application Layer Firewall operates
                at the socket layer, bound to individual processes. The
                Application Layer Firewall can therefore make filtering
                decisions on a per-application basis. Of the two firewall
                engines, only the Application Layer Firewall is fully exposed in
                the Leopard user interface. The new firewall offers less control
                over individual packet decisions (users can decide to allow or
                deny connections system-wide or to individual applications, but
                must use IPFW to set fine-grained TCP/IP header-level policies).
                It also makes several policy exceptions for system processes:
                neither mDNSResponder nor programs running with superuser
                privileges are filtered.
              </p>

              <span class="level-three">Sandboxes</span>
              <p>
                Leopard includes kernel-level support for role-based access
                control (RBAC). RBAC is intended to prevent, for example, an
                application like Mail from editing the password database.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="level-three">Application Signing</span>
              <p>
                Leopard provides a framework to use public key signatures for
                code signing to verify, in some circumstances, that code has not
                been tampered with. Signatures can also be used to ensure that
                one program replacing another is truly an "update", and carry
                any special security privileges across to the new version. This
                reduces the number of user security prompts, and the likelihood
                of the user being trained to simply clicking "OK" to everything.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="level-three">Secure Guest Account</span>
              <p>
                Guests can be given access to a Leopard system with an account
                that the system erases and resets at logout.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Security features in Leopard have been criticized as weak or
            ineffective, with the publisher Heise Security documenting that the
            Leopard installer downgraded firewall protection and exposed
            services to attack even when the firewall was re-enabled. Several
            researchers noted that the Library Randomization feature added to
            Leopard was ineffective compared to mature implementations on other
            platforms, and that the new "secure Guest account" could be abused
            by Guests to retain access to the system even after the Leopard log
            out process erased their home directory.

      <summary class="level-one">User interface</summary>
      <p>
        Mac OS X Leopard made many changes to the user interface. This includes
        a more detailed, transparent menu bar, skeuomorphic system icons, and a
        glossy, reflective, 3D Dock. Windows lost their metallic, lined look
        they had previously. As well as this, the Apple icon is now black
        instead of blue. This is notably very similar to IPhone OS 1's user
        interface. Rory Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized a number of
        changes to Leopard's user interface, including the transparent menu bar
        and the new folder icons. Decreased transparency of the menu bar, along
        with the ability to disable the menu bar transparency were added with
        the 10.5.2 release on February 11, 2008.
