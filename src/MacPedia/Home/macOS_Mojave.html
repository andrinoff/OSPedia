      macOS Mojave (pronounced mo-HAH-vee) is the fifteenth major release of
      macOS, Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers.
      macOS Mojave was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on
      June 4, 2018, and was released to the public on September 24. The
      operating system's name refers to the Mojave Desert, continuing the use of
      California-themed names that began with OS X Mavericks. It succeeded macOS
      High Sierra and was followed by macOS Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last
      version of macOS that features the iTunes and Dashboard apps.

      macOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system,
      including Apple News, Voice Memos, and Home. It also includes a more
      comprehensive "dark mode", is the final version of macOS to support 32-bit
      application software, is the last version of the macOS capable of being
      booted from an HFS+ partition without third-party patching, and is also
      the last version of macOS to support the iPhoto app, which had already
      been superseded in OS X Yosemite (10.10) by the newer Photos app.
    </p>
    <p>
      macOS Mojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases
      after launch.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Mojave requires a GPU that supports Metal, and the list of
        officially-compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous
        version, macOS High Sierra. Mojave drops support for various Macs
        released from late 2009 to 2011. Compatible models are the following
        Macintosh computers running OS X Mountain Lion or later:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>
          Mac Pro (2013, 2010-2012 supported with a Metal-capable graphics
          card)/li>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        macOS Mojave requires at least 2 GB of RAM as well as 12.5 GB of
        available disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or
        macOS High Sierra, or 18.5 GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X
        Yosemite and earlier releases. Some features are not available on all
        compatible models. Mojave installations convert the installation volume
        to Apple File System (APFS), if the volume had not previously been
        converted from HFS+.
      </p>

      <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
      <span class="level-two">System updates</span>
      <p>
        macOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS.
        The graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the
        operating system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are
        encouraged to use Apple's Metal library instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide
        range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build
        support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning
        QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take
        advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a
        variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its
        efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop
        use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the
        abstraction layer and running on the "bare metal". Metal reduces CPU
        load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and
        improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to
        the GPU.
      </p>
      <p>
        macOS does not natively support Vulkan, the Khronos group's official
        successor to OpenGL. The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge,
        translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing the process started in macOS High Sierra (10.13), which
        issued warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave
        issues warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported
        in future updates. In macOS Mojave 10.14, this alert appears once every
        30 days when launching the app, as macOS 10.15 will not support 32-bit
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Mojave is installed, it will convert solid-state drives (SSDs),
        hard disk drives (HDDs), and Fusion Drives, from HFS Plus to APFS. On
        Fusion Drives using APFS, files will be moved to the SSD based on the
        file's frequency of use and its SSD performance profile. APFS will also
        store all metadata for a Fusion Drive's file system on the SSD.
      </p>
      <p>
        New data protections require applications to get permission from the
        user before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data
        like user Mail history and Messages database.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mojave removes integrations with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vimeo,
          and Flickr, which were added in OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mojave also removes support for sub-pixel rendering of text. The
          feature was previously used on non-Retina displays to improve the
          appearance of text on screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K5000 and
          GeForce GTX 680 Mac Edition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Applications</span>
      <p>
        Mojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones.
        Finder now has metadata preview accessed via View > Show Preview, and
        many other updates, including a Gallery View (replacing Cover Flow) that
        lets users browse through files visually. After a screenshot is taken,
        the image appears in the corner of the display, as with iOS. The
        screenshot software can now record video, choose where to save files,
        and be opened via <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> +
        <kbd>5</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Safari's Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media "Like" or
        "Share" buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without
        permission. The browser also sends less information to web servers about
        the user's system, reducing the chance of being tracked based on system
        configuration. It can also automatically create, autofill, and store
        strong passwords when users create new online accounts; it also flags
        reused passwords so users can change them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app.
        Screenshot can capture a selected area, window or the entire screen as
        well as screen record a selected area or the entire display. The
        Screenshot app is located in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder, as was
        the Grab app. Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing
        <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>
        macOS 10.14.1, released on October 30, 2018, adds Group FaceTime, which
        lets users chat with up to 32 people at the same time, using video or
        audio from an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or audio from Apple Watch.
        Participants can join in mid-conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new
        interface and editorial content, similar to the iOS App Store. A new
        'Discover' tab highlights new and updated apps; Create, Work, Play and
        Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four new apps (News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home) are ported to macOS
        Mojave from iOS, with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the
        desktop OS. Third-party developers would be able to port iOS
        applications to macOS in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Home, Mac users can control their HomeKit-enabled accessories to do
        things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings. Voice
        Memos lets users record audio (e.g., personal notes, lectures, meetings,
        interviews, or song ideas), and access them from iPhone, iPad or Mac.
        Stocks delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist,
        with quotes and charts.

        Mojave revamps Dark Mode. A light-on-dark color scheme, it initially
        affected only the dock, menu bar, and drop-down menus, while here, it
        darkens the entire user interface to make content stand out while the
        interface recedes. Users can choose dark or light mode when installing
        Mojave, or any time thereafter from System Preferences. All of the
        built-in apps support the revamp. App developers can implement the
        feature in their apps via a public API.

        Stacks, a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard, now lets users group
        desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind,
        date last opened, date modified, date created, name and tags. This is
        accessed via View > Use Stacks.

        macOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes
        specially made desktop backgrounds (two of which are included) to match
        the time of day.

        The Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously
        been added to the Dock.

        macOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences
        from the Mac App Store. In OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), system and app
        updates moved to the App Store from Software Update.
