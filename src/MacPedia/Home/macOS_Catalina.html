      macOS Catalina (version 10.15) is the sixteenth major release of macOS,
      Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. It is the
      successor to macOS Mojave and was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019
      and released to the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first
      version of macOS to support only 64-bit applications and the first to
      include Activation Lock. It is also the last version of macOS to have the
      major version number be 10.x; its successor, Big Sur, released on November
      12, 2020, is version 11. In order to increase web compatibility, Safari,
      Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS in the user agent running in
      subsequent releases of macOS at 10.15.7 Catalina.

      macOS Catalina is the final version of macOS that supports the Unibody
      MacBook Pro, as its successor, macOS Big Sur, drops support for its
      mid-2012 and final model. The Unibody MacBook Pro was a design of the
      MacBook Pro used from 2008-2012.

      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>
        All standard configuration Macs that supported macOS Mojave support
        macOS Catalina. 2010 to 2012 Mac Pros, which could run Mojave only with
        a GPU upgrade, are no longer supported. Catalina requires 4 GB of
        memory, an increase over the 2 GB required by Lion through Mojave.

        It is unofficially possible to install macOS Catalina on many older
        Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This
        requires using a patch to modify the install image. "dosdude1"'s
        Catalina Patcher is an example of those tools, which can be used to
        Install Catalina on machines between 2008 and 2011.

      <div class="div-level-two">
        <span class="level-three">Catalyst</span>
        <p>
          Catalyst is a new software-development tool that allows developers to
          write apps that can run on macOS, iOS and iPadOS. Apple demonstrated
          several ported apps, including Jira and Twitter (after the latter
          discontinued its macOS app in February 2018).
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">System extensions</span>
        <p>
          An upgrade from Kexts. System extensions avoid the problems of Kexts
          (kernel extensions). There are 3 kinds of System extensions: Network
          Extensions, Endpoint Security Extensions, and Driver Extensions.
          System extensions run in userspace, outside of the kernel. Catalina
          will be the last version of macOS to support legacy system extensions.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">DriverKit</span>
        <p>
          A replacement for IOKit device drivers, driver extensions are built
          using DriverKit. DriverKit is a new SDK with all-new frameworks based
          on IOKit, but updated and modernized. It is designed for building
          device drivers in userspace, outside of the kernel.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Gatekeeper</span>
        <p>
          Mac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed
          with a Developer ID must be notarized by Apple to run on macOS
          Catalina.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Activation Lock</span>
        <p>
          Activation Lock helps prevent the unauthorized use and drive erasure
          of devices with an Apple T2 security chip (2018, 2019, and 2020
          MacBook Pro; 2020 5K iMac; 2018 MacBook Air, iMac Pro; 2018 Mac Mini;
          2019 Mac Pro).
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Dedicated system volume</span>
        <p>
          The system runs on its own read-only volume, separate from all other
          data on the Mac.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Voice control</span>
        <p>
          Users can give detailed voice commands to applications. On-device
          machine processing is used to offer better navigation.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Sidecar</span>
        <p>
          Sidecar allows a Mac to use an iPad (running iPadOS) as a wireless
          external display. With Apple Pencil, the device can also be used as a
          graphics tablet for software running on the computer. Sidecar requires
          a Mac with Intel Skylake CPUs and newer (such as the fourth-generation
          MacBook Pro), and an iPad that supports Apple Pencil.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Support for wireless game controllers</span>
        <p>
          The Game Controller framework adds support for two major console game
          controllers: the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 and the Xbox One
          controller.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Time Machine</span>
        <p>
          A number of under-the-hood changes were made to Time Machine, the
          backup software. For example, the manner in which backup data is
          stored on network-attached devices was changed, and this change is not
          backwards-compatible with earlier versions of macOS. Apple declined to
          document these changes, but some of them have been noted.
        </p>

      <span class="level-two">Applications</span>
      <div class="div-level-two">
        <span class="level-three">iTunes</span>
        <p>
          iTunes is replaced by separate Music, Podcasts, TV and Books apps, in
          line with iOS. iOS device management is now conducted via Finder. The
          TV app on Mac supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on
          MacBooks released in 2018 or later, while 4K HDR playback is supported
          on Macs released in 2018 or later when connected to a compatible
          display.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Find My</span>
        <p>
          Find My Mac and Find My Friends are merged into an application called
          Find My.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
        <p>
          The Notes application was enhanced to allow better management of
          checklists and the ability to share folders with other users. The
          application version was incremented from 4.6 (in macOS 10.14 Mojave)
          to 4.7.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Reminders</span>
        <p>
          Among other visual and functional overhauls, attachments can be added
          to reminders and Siri can intelligently estimate when to remind the
          user about an event.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Voice Memos</span>
        <p>
          The Voice Memos application, first ported from iOS to the Mac in macOS
          10.14 Mojave as version 2.0, was incremented to version 2.1.
        </p>
      </div>
      <span class="level-two">Removed or changed components</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          macOS Catalina exclusively supports 64-bit applications. 32-bit
          applications no longer run (including all software that utilizes the
          Carbon API as well as QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video
          codecs). Apple has also removed all 32-bit-only apps from the Mac App
          Store.
        </li>
        <li>
          Z shell (executable "zsh") is the default login shell and interactive
          shell in macOS Catalina, replacing Bash, the default shell since Mac
          OS X Panther in 2003. Bash continues to be available in macOS
          Catalina, along with other shells such as csh/tcsh and ksh.
        </li>
        <li>Dashboard has been removed in macOS Catalina.</li>
        <li>
          The ability to add Backgrounds in Photo Booth was removed in macOS
          Catalina.
        </li>
        <li>
          The command-line interface GNU Emacs application was removed in macOS
          Catalina.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built-in support for Perl, Python 2.7 and Ruby are included in macOS
          for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS will
          not include scripting language runtimes by default, possibly requiring
          users to install additional packages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legacy AirDrop for connecting with Macs running Mac OS X Lion,
          Mountain Lion and Mavericks, or 2011 and older Macs has been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support for legacy Safari extensions such as uBlock Origin, and WebSQL
          has been removed in Safari 13.
        </li>
        <li>Circular app icons now have outlines matching their main color.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Security</span>
      <p>
        Ars Technica reported that macOS Catalina contained a critical privilege
        escalation vulnerability, which resulted in a backdoor being installed
        if users visited a Hong Kong pro-democracy website. The vulnerability
        was reported to Apple in August 2021 and patched in a Catalina update in
        September, but it had already been patched by Apple in macOS Big Sur
        11.2, released 234 days earlier on February 1. Security experts have
        criticized Apple for not patching critical known vulnerabilities in
        older versions and for not being transparent about older versions only
        receiving some, but not all, security patches. The latest major release
        of Apple's operating systems (macOS, iOS, and others) receive all
        security updates.
