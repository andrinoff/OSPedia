      OS X Lion, also known as Mac OS X Lion, (version 10.7) is the eighth major
      release of macOS, Apple's desktop and server operating syste for Mac
      computers. A preview of OS X 10.7 Lion was publicly shown at the "Back to
      the Mac" Apple Special Event on October 20, 2010. It brought many
      developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of
      installed applications, to the Mac, and includes support for the Mac App
      Store, as introduced in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard version 10.6.6. On
      February 24, 2011, the first developer's preview of Lion (11A390) was
      released to subscribers to the Apple Developer program. Other developer
      previews were subsequently released, with Lion Preview 4 (11A480b) being
      released at WWDC 2011.

      Lion was released to manufacturing on July 1, 2011, followed by its final
      release via the Mac App Store on July 20, 2011. Apple reported over one
      million Lion sales on the first day of its release. As of October 2011, OS
      X Lion had sold over six million copies worldwide. Mac OS X 10.7.1 was the
      last version of Mac OS X released under CEO Steve Jobs. 10.7.2 and later
      were released under CEO Tim Cook. 10.7.5 added Gatekeeper. Lion is the
      first version of macOS that did not support 32-bit processors and is also
      the final release whose development was overseen by Bertrand Serlet,
      considered to be the "founding father of Mac OS X".
    </p>
    <p>
      Although originally paid, Apple later allowed free downloads of the OS,
      especially for customers of older and no longer officially supported Mac
      computers, starting on June 30, 2021. The same practice was applied to its
      successor, OS X Mountain Lion.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">Release and distribution</summary>
      <p>
        On June 6, 2011, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, it was
        announced that the official release for Lion would be in July 2011. The
        specific release date of July 20 was not confirmed until the day before,
        July 19, by Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, as part of Apple's 2011
        third-quarter earnings announcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple did not initially announce any physical media distribution for
        Lion, such as a set of CD-ROMs or a DVD-ROM as used for past releases.
        Instead, the operating system was said to be available exclusively as a
        download from the Mac App Store for US$29.99. The only prior version of
        OS X that supports the Mac App Store is Snow Leopard, which implied that
        any machines that support Lion currently running Tiger or Leopard
        rewould first have to be upgraded to Snow Leopard, as opposed to
        allowing a direct upgrade to Lion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple later announced two alternative distribution mechanisms for the
        benefit of users without broadband Internet access: in-store downloads
        at retail Apple Stores, and a USB flash drive containing the OS, priced
        at US$69, available through the online Apple Store beginning in August.
        On August 4, 2011, Apple started to take orders for OS X Lion's USB
        installation flash drives for $69.99.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Server portion of Lion is available as a separate download from the
        Mac App Store for US$49.99, which is in addition to the purchase price
        of Lion itself. In July 2012, Lion was removed from the Mac App Store
        and retail Apple stores following the release of OS X Mountain Lion.
        Following the removal of Lion from the Mac App Store, customers could
        still purchase Lion by phone at the reduced price of $20. In October
        2013, Lion was returned to the Apple Store website concurrently with
        Mountain Lion following the release of OS X Mavericks for the
        convenience of users who cannot run Mavericks on older Mac models.

      <summary class="level-one">Hardware support</summary>
      <p>
        The first developer preview of Lion added TRIM support for Solid-state
        drives (SSD) shipped with Macs, which is also included in the latest
        version of Snow Leopard (10.6.8) shipping with MacBook Pros before July
        20, 2011. Other SSDs have built-in TRIM-like optimization, while yet
        others require OS patching.

      <summary class="level-one">New and changed features</summary>
      <p>
        Some new features were announced at the "Back to the Mac" keynote in
        October 2010, and the Apple website was updated in February 2011 with
        more details. Other features were announced at the WWDC 2011 keynote or
        on Apple's OS X Lion Web site after the keynote. Apple stated that there
        were over 250 new or changed features in Lion, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Address Book uses an iPad-like user interface. It also includes
          improved Yahoo support and FaceTime calling.
        </li>
        <li>
          AirDrop – Lion-to-Lion direct file sharing via Wi-Fi Direct, with no
          wireless access point required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Address space layout randomization – Address space layout
          randomization (ASLR), a security technique that puts important data in
          unpredictable locations, making it harder to target known weaknesses,
          is available for 32-bit applications, and "has been improved for all
          applications", in Lion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apple Push Notification Service – Send over-the-air alerts, such as
          news updates or social networking status changes, using Apple's Push
          Notification service to applications that support APNS. APNS allows OS
          X Lion and iOS clients to receive push changes to items such as mail,
          calendar and contacts from a configured OS X Lion Server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Auto-correction behaves much like on iOS devices, displaying an
          iOS-like popup box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Auto Save – As in iOS, documents in applications written to use Auto
          Save are saved automatically so users do not have to worry about
          manually managing their documents. The Auto Save feature significantly
          alters traditional workflow patterns and is a controversial addition
          to the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emoji support – Apple has added a new Emoji font commonly used in chat
          to express ideograms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exposé in the Dock, a way of activating Exposé for a single
          application from the Dock, a feature added in Mac OS X 10.6, is
          altered. One must double-tap with two fingers on a dock icon to
          initiate single-application Exposé, or simply right-click or
          control-click and select Show All Windows.
        </li>
        <li>FaceTime comes bundled with Lion.</li>
        <li>
          FileVault offers full disk encryption and added security with XTS-AES
          128 data encryption. Support for FileVault on external hard drives has
          also been added.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finder improvements – Finder search allows multiple search criteria to
          be specified without creating a smart folder, Finder search offers
          suggestions, files can be grouped by various attributes, and one can
          merge files under two folders with the same name – a prompt appears
          asking to replace or keep both files. The navigation sidebar lost the
          ability to show the specific icon of a map or volume (by default;
          there is a hack to still add the old ability), instead it shows a grey
          standard map icon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Font Book 3 – Font Book 3 provides more flexible displays of character
          glyphs supplied by a particular font face. Duplicate font files are
          flagged with a warning icon, and can be fixed automatically or
          resolved manually.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full-screen apps – Native, system-wide support for full-screen
          applications running in their own space. Supporting applications
          display a new button at the top right of application window, this
          button opens applications in full-screen mode. However, full screen
          mode is not supported for dual screen setups.
        </li>
        <li>
          High-quality multilingual speech voices – users can download new
          high-quality voices in more than forty languages and dialects.
        </li>
        <li>
          iCal has an updated user interface, an annual view, and support for a
          full-screen view.
        </li>
        <li>
          iChat has support for logging into Yahoo! Messenger. Users can audio-
          and video-chat with other iChat users using their Yahoo! accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Languages/Localization – Arabic, Czech, Turkish and Hungarian are
          added as full system languages, to make the total number of twenty-two
          languages available in Mac OS X.
        </li>
        <li>
          Launchpad – An application launcher that displays an iOS-like icon
          grid of installed applications. It features the ability to make
          multiple pages and group apps into folders that function the same as
          folders in iOS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mac App Store – receives support for in app purchases as with iOS, and
          alters the update mechanism to no longer create a separate copy of the
          app, improving performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mail 5 – Uses an iPad-like user interface, has a fullscreen-optimized
          view, uses chronological "Conversations" to organize messages, and
          supports Exchange 2010 (but not through the Exchange ActiveSync
          protocol, as iOS).
        </li>
        <li>
          Mission Control replaces the "All windows" Exposé feature. It gives an
          overview of all running applications just like "All windows" but
          groups windows from the same application. At the top of the screen it
          gives quick access to the Dashboard, Spaces, and running full-screen
          applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multi-touch gestures – Similar to iOS, additional gestures performed
          using a multi-touch input device (e.g. Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad)
          allow the user to scroll, swipe to different pages, and enter Mission
          Control. While this is not the first official multi-touch support for
          Mac OS X, it has been expanded; other frameworks, such as Lux, have
          already created multi-touch support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multi-User Screen Sharing – The built-in Screen Sharing feature allows
          remote users to log into a separate user account from the one that is
          currently logged in. While one user is logged into a machine, a second
          user can log into the same machine remotely, seeing their own desktop
          and user environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preview gains several features, including full-screen support and the
          ability to sign a document just by holding a signed piece of paper up
          to the camera.
        </li>
        <li>
          Profile Manager provides several features, including push
          notification-based management of OS X Lion and above.
        </li>
        <li>
          QuickTime reincorporates some features from QuickTime Pro. New
          features cited include Copy/Paste, Insert Clip, Crop Video, Rotate
          Video, Resize, Trim, and more Export options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recovery Partition – Apple has introduced a recovery partition that
          includes utilities generally found on the OS X discs. This partition
          enables the user to restore their computer to its original factory
          state without the original installer media such as a flash drive. If
          the partition were to become damaged or otherwise not available, such
          as with a new drive, a new copy of OS X Lion can be installed over the
          internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resume – Applications resume in the same state when re-opened as
          already seen in iOS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safari – With full-screen mode and the new WebKit2 layout engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          System Information – This feature is a re-design of System Profiler,
          which has been completely altered with new views which display
          graphical information on displays, storage devices, memory usage along
          with other hardware information. The previous layout remains available
          by clicking "System Report". Early builds of Lion also used System
          Information as a replacement for "About This Mac", although the final
          release reinstated the version of this dialog box found in Snow
          Leopard.
        </li>
        <li>Terminal has extra features, including full screen mode.</li>
        <li>
          TextEdit gains a new graphical toolbar with font selection and text
          highlighting. The new TextEdit also supports Apple's new automatic
          file saving and versions technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Versions – Time Machine-like saving and browsing of past versions of
          documents for applications written to use Versions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vertical text – Lion supports vertical layouts for East Asian
          languages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The complete list was on Apple's website but has since been taken down;
        it can now be found on the Internet Archive. The developer release notes
        may also be of interest.

      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Server Features</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wiki Server 3 – Making it easier to collaborate, share, and exchange
            information. Users can quickly switch between a server's home page,
            My Page, Updates, Wikis, People, and Podcasts. File sharing is
            simpler, and a new Page Editor is added for easy customization.
          </li>
          <li>
            WebDAV File Sharing – Lion Server delivers wireless file sharing for
            clients that support WebDAV. Enabling WebDAV in Lion Server gives
            iOS users the ability to access, copy, and share documents on the
            server from applications such as Keynote, Numbers, and Pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Profile Manager – Profile Manager delivers simple, profile-based
            setup and management for OS X Lion, iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch
            devices. It also integrates with existing directory services and
            delivers automatic over-the-air profile updates using the Apple Push
            Notification service.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">User interface changes</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Redesigned Aqua user interface elements, including new appearances
            for buttons and progress bars. The red, yellow, and green buttons in
            the window decorations have also been made smaller, with a slightly
            changed design.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexible window resizing from any corner or edge of the window,
            similar to window resizing in Microsoft Windows and many window
            managers for X11.
          </li>
          <li>
            The metal finish has also been slightly altered. It is a lighter
            shade of grey and features a speckled texture.
          </li>
          <li>Scrollbar arrows have been removed.</li>
          <li>
            Scrolling is reversed by default, to act more like a touch screen
            device, so that content moves in the direction of finger movement on
            touch-pad or mouse (with the scrollbar moving in the opposite
            direction), rather than the scrollbar moving in the direction of
            finger movement (with the content moving in the opposite direction).
            Also, like in iOS, scrolling "bounces" when the scroll bar hits the
            top or bottom of the window.
          </li>
          <li>
            When resizing a window by clicking on the green button (left-top), a
            transform effect animates the enlargement.
          </li>
          <li>New windows fly to the front (like opening an app in iOS).</li>
          <li>
            The dashboard is its own space in Mission Control, rather than in
            previous versions of OS X where the widgets simply flew in and the
            background dimmed. As a result, there is no more "ripple effect" on
            the background when adding a widget, as was seen on previous
            versions of Mac OS X that had the previous dashboard. Users have the
            option to return the dashboard to its previous configuration in
            System Preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tabs, when selected, have a recessed and darkened appearance as
            opposed to previous versions where selected tabs were highlighted in
            aqua blue.

        <summary class="level-two">Dropped features</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Save As – replaced by Duplicate and Revert functions due to the
            introduction of Auto Save and Versions (only applies to applications
            modified to support Auto Save, such as TextEdit; applications not
            modified to support Auto Save, such as Microsoft Word, retain this
            functionality).

            Front Row, a media center application. The application has been
            copied into Lion by third-party users, however its incompatibility
            with iTunes 10.4 renders some features useless.

            Rosetta, software that makes possible the execution of PowerPC
            software on x86 hardware, is no longer available. This disables some
            programs that ran on previous versions of Mac OS X. Programs
            requiring Rosetta to operate are not allowed to be distributed via
            the Mac App Store.

            Adobe Flash Player and Apple's Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are
            not included in new installations of Lion, but both can still be
            downloaded and installed manually. Apple is no longer actively
            maintaining its JRE, but Software Update offers to download Snow
            Leopard's JRE when a user tries to run a Java program and the JRE is
            not installed. Programs using Java are not allowed to be distributed
            via the Mac App Store.

          <li>
            iSync, software used for syncing contacts and calendars to
            third-party mobile phones, is no longer included; however, iSync
            v3.1.2 from Snow Leopard continues to work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remote Install Mac OS X, software that allows OS X to be installed
            using the Remote Disk feature. Using Target Disk Mode, users can
            circumvent this omission. This is replaced by the Recovery
            Partition, which does exactly the same thing but without needing an
            external disk, as long as the hard disk is not damaged.

            QuickTime Streaming Server, software used to deliver video and audio
            on request to users over a computer network, including the Internet.

          <li>
            WPA Enterprise configuration for wireless networks was replaced by
            the requirement to obtain a configuration profile.

            Applications that depend on Rosetta, such as Office for Mac 2004,
            AppleWorks, and early versions of Quicken for Mac 2007, are no
            longer supported. This affects applications listed as Classic or
            PowerPC in System Profiler.
