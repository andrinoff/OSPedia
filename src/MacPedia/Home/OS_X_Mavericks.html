    <p>
      OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) is the 10th major release of macOS, Apple
      Inc.'s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. OS X
      Mavericks was announced on June 10, 2013, at WWDC 2013, and was released
      on October 22, 2013, worldwide. It was also the last version to use a
      mostly skeuomorphic design; the next release, OS X Yosemite, featured a
      redesign of the user interface appearance. It was also the first version
      of macOS to be offered only on the App Store, rather than on a physical
      disk.

    <p>
      The update emphasized battery life, Finder improvements, other
      improvements for power users, and increased iCloud integration, as well as
      bringing more of Apple's iOS apps to OS X. Mavericks was named after the
      surfing location in Northern California.It also removed some of the
      skeuomorphic designs from OS X Mountain Lion, and it is the final version
      of macOS that features the Lucida Grande typeface as the standard system
      font since Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mavericks was the first OS X release to be named after a location in
      California, and the first to be a free upgrade since Mac OS X 10.1 Puma.

      <summary class="level-one">History</summary>
      <p>
        Apple announced OS X Mavericks on June 10, 2013, during the company's
        Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote (which also
        introduced iOS 7, a revised MacBook Air, the sixth-generation AirPort
        Extreme, the fifth-generation AirPort Time Capsule, and a redesigned Mac
        Pro). During a keynote on October 22, 2013, Apple announced that the
        official release of 10.9 on the Mac App Store would be available
        immediately, and that unlike previous versions of OS X, 10.9 would be
        available at no charge to all users running Snow Leopard (10.6.8) or
        later.
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 22, 2013, Apple offered free upgrades for life on OS X and
        iWork.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The menu bar and the Dock are available on each display.
            Additionally, AirPlay compatible displays such as the Apple TV can
            be used as an external display. Mission Control has been updated to
            organize and switch between Desktop workspaces independently between
            multiple displays.
          </li>
          <li>
            OS X Mavericks introduced App Nap, which sleeps apps that are not
            currently visible. Any app running on Mavericks can be eligible for
            this feature by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compressed Memory is a virtual memory compression system which
            automatically compresses data from inactive apps when approaching
            maximum memory capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Timer coalescing is a feature that enhances energy efficiency by
            reducing CPU usage by up to 72 percent. This allows MacBooks to run
            for longer periods of time and desktop Macs to run cooler.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apple now supports OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile and OpenCL 1.2. Server
            Message Block version 2 (SMB2) is now the default protocol for
            sharing files, rather than AFP. This is to increase performance and
            cross-platform compatibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some skeuomorphs, such as the leather texture in Calendar, the legal
            pad theme of Notes, and the book-like appearance of Contacts, have
            been removed from the UI and replaced with flat design similar to
            iOS 7.
          </li>
          <li>
            iCloud Keychain stores a user's usernames, passwords and Wi-Fi
            passwords to allow the user to fill this information into forms when
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>The system has native LinkedIn sharing integration.</li>
          <li>
            IPoTB (Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge) Thunderbolt
            networking is supported in Mavericks. This feature allows the user
            to quickly transfer a large amount of data between two Macs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notification Center allows the user to reply to notifications
            instantly, allows websites to send notifications, and, when the user
            wakes up a Mac that was in a sleep state, displays a summary of
            missed notifications before the machine is unlocked. Some system
            alerts, such as low battery, removal of drives without ejecting, and
            a failed Time Machine backup have been moved to Notification Center.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "traffic light" close, minimize, and maximize window buttons
            have appeared somewhat brighter than OS X Lion and OS X Mountain
            Lion.

        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Removed features</summary>
        <p>
          The Open Transport API has been removed. USB syncing of calendar,
          contacts and other information to iOS devices has been removed,
          instead requiring the use of iCloud. QuickTime 10 no longer supports
          many older video codecs and converts them to the ProRes format when
          opened. Older video codecs cannot be viewed in Quick Look. Apple also
          removed the ability to sync mobile iCloud Notes if iOS devices were
          upgraded from iOS 8 to iOS 9, effectively forcing all Mavericks users
          to update or upgrade their computers.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">App features</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Finder gets enhancements such as tabs, full-screen support, and
            document tags. Pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-navigate-history gestures
            have been removed, although both are supported anywhere else.
          </li>
          <li>
            The new iBooks application allows the user to read books purchased
            through the iBooks Store. The app also allows the user to purchase
            new content from the iBooks Store, and a night mode to make it
            easier to read in dark environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            The new Maps application adds the same functionalities that were
            featured in iOS Maps. Among these new features is the capability to
            search directions for driving and walking, report problems in the
            Maps application, and viewing street addresses to Maps via the
            Contacts application.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Calendar app has enhancements such as being able to add Facebook
            events, view the map of a specified location, and an estimate for
            the travel time to an event.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Safari browser has a significantly enhanced JavaScript
            performance which Apple claims is faster than Chrome and Firefox. A
            Top Sites view allows the user to quickly access the most viewed
            sites by default. However, the user can pin or remove websites from
            the view. The sidebar now allows the user to view their bookmarks,
            reading list and shared links. Safari can also auto-generate random
            passwords and remember them through iCloud Keychain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additional changes were made to the messaging system. FaceTime is
            updated so that the user no longer needs to enable camera, in a
            similar manner to FaceTime in iOS 7. OS X Mavericks 10.9.2 added the
            option to block users in iMessage.
