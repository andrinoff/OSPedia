        <li>
          Provisions to allow the planned introduction of Universal Control,
          which allows a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple Macs and
          iPads. It works on Macs with Apple silicon and some with an Intel
          processor, including MacBook Pro (2016 and later), MacBook (2016 and
          later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2017 and later), iMac (5K
          Retina, 27-inch, Late 2015), iMac Pro, Mac Mini (2018 and later), and
          Mac Pro (2019). It works on these iPads: iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd
          generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini
          (5th generation and later).
        </li>
        <li>Support for the Apple Music Voice Plan Subscription.</li>
        <li>
          Portrait Mode and Noise Cancellation features for FaceTime and some
          apps (in Control Center).
        </li>
        <li>
          New Toolbar features and designs for Finder and the Preview app.

          text from images displayed by Photos, Screenshot, Quick Look, and
          Safari.
        </li>
        <li>New Passwords Manager for Mac</li>
        <li>
          New on-device machine-learning-activated keyboard dictation using
          Siri, and also now for almost unlimited duration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low Power Mode for Mac that enables longer battery life for
          lightweight workflows such as reading PDFs, Web browsing, listening to

          set to "Everyone" or "Anyone on the same network" in Sharing
          preferences.
        </li>
        <li>

          The Time Machine backup functionality excludes more system files.
        </li>
        <li>

          the user's iCloud photos.

      <span class="level-two">Applications</span>
      <div class="div-level-two">
        <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
        <p>
          In the Notes application, users can now apply arbitrary tags to a note
          (e.g., #cooking, #work); groups of notes with a given tag or tags can
          be viewed in Smart Folders or a Tag Browser in the sidebar. The new
          Quick Notes function enables a user to create a note from within any
          app via system-wide keyboard shortcut or hot corner.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Maps</span>
        <p>

          forest detail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Messages supports new features, also introduced in iOS 15, such as
          "Shared with You" which provides shortcut links to content shared via
          Messages in other Apple apps such as Safari, Photos, Music, and News.
        </p>
        <p>
          When multiple photos are sent/received, they are now displayed as a
          collection instead of multiple messages. A download button is provided
          to download all photos simultaneously.
