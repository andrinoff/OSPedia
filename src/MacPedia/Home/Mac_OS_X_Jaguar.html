    <p>
      Mac OS X Jaguar (version 10.2) is the third major release of macOS,
      Apple's desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.1
      and preceded Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was released on August
      23, 2002. It was available both for single-computer installations and in a
      "family pack" that allowed five installations on separate computers in one
      household. Jaguar was the first Mac OS X release to publicly use its code
      name in marketing and advertisements.

      <p>
        Mac OS X Jaguar requires a PowerPC G3 or G4 CPU and 128 MB of RAM.
        Special builds were released for the first PowerPC G5 systems released
        by Apple.
      </p>

      <summary class="level-one">New and changed features</summary>
      <p>
        Jaguar introduced many new features to Mac OS X, which are still
        supported to this day, including MPEG-4 support in QuickTime, Address
        Book, and Inkwell for handwriting recognition. It also included the
        first release of Apple's Zeroconf implementation, Rendezvous (later
        renamed to Bonjour), which allows devices on the same network to
        automatically discover each other and offer available services, such as
        file sharing, shared scanners, and printers, to the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mac OS X Jaguar Server 10.2.2 added journaling to HFS Plus, the native
        Macintosh file system, to add increased reliability and data recovery
        features. This was later added to the standard Mac OS X in version 10.3
        Panther.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jaguar saw the debut of Quartz Extreme, a technology used to composite
        graphics directly on the video card, without the use of software to
        composite windows. The technology allotted the task of drawing the 3D
        surface of windows to the video card, rather than to the CPU, to
        increase interface responsiveness and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Universal Access was added to allow the Macintosh to be usable by
        disabled computer users.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user interface of Jaguar was also updated to add search features to
        the Finder, powered by Sherlock 3.
      </p>

      <p>
        Internally, Jaguar also added the Common Unix Printing System (also
        known as CUPS), a modular printing system for Unix-like operating
        systems, and improved support for Microsoft Windows networks using the
        open-source Samba as a server for the SMB remote file access protocol
        and a FreeBSD-derived virtual file system module as a client for SMB.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Happy Mac startup icon that was introduced with the original
        Macintosh was replaced with a grey Apple logo. The gray startup screen
        was used up until OS X Yosemite.
