      It is named after the city of Ventura and is the tenth macOS release to
      bear a name from the company's home state of California. The macOS 13
      Ventura logo, official graphics and default wallpaper resemble an abstract
      California poppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      macOS Ventura is the last version of macOS supporting Macs released in
      2017, including the 21.5-inch 2017 iMac and the 12-inch MacBook, with the
      exception of the iMac Pro, which is supported by releases up to macOS
      Sequoia.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Ventura is the last release for Macs with Apple T1 Security chip.
        macOS Ventura officially supports Macs with Apple silicon and Intel's
        Skylake-based Xeon-W and 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips or later, and
        drops support for Macs released from 2015 to 2016, officially marking
        the end of support for the Retina MacBook Pro, 2015-2017 MacBook Air,
        2014 Mac Mini, 2015 iMac and cylindrical Mac Pro. The 2016 MacBook Pro
        is also dropped, however, the operating system can be installed and run
        using OpenCore because all required drivers for T1 system are present
        (drivers are removed in macOS Sonoma). The 21.5 inch 2017 iMac is the
        only supported standard configuration model to have no Retina display.
      </p>
      <p>Macs that support macOS Ventura are as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (2017 or later)</li>
        <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
        <li>MacBook (2017)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (2018 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (2017 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (2018 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (2019 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Studio (all models)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AirPlay to Mac, always-on "Hey Siri", 4K HDR streaming, and Spatial
        Audio are not supported on all models. Offline dictation, Live Captions,
        Portrait Mode in FaceTime, and "Reference mode" (which allows users to
        use an iPad as a secondary reference monitor) only work on Apple silicon
        Macs.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two"
        >Unofficial support on older models (discontinued hardware)</span
      >
      <p>
        By using patch tools, macOS Ventura can be unofficially installed on
        earlier models that are officially unsupported, such as a 2017 MacBook
        Air and a 2015 MacBook Pro. Using these methods, it is possible to
        install macOS Ventura on models as early as a 2008 MacBook Pro or a 2007
        iMac (after a Penryn CPU upgrade).

      <summary class="level-one">Features and Changes</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Ventura includes changes, many related to productivity, and adds
        two apps from iOS and iPadOS: Weather and Clock. Freeform was added in
        an update to all three operating systems.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two">New system features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stage Manager, which provides an alternative interface for
          multitasking, in addition to the previous Mission Control.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">New apps</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Weather: shows detailed weather forecasts. Clicking on the Weather
          widget now opens this app, not The Weather Channel's website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clock: displays world time and manages alarms, stopwatches, and
          timers. Clicking on the Clock widget now opens this app, not the Date
          & Time section of System Preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Freeform: a whiteboard app that supports real-time collaboration. It
          was only added in version 13.1.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Changes</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mail adds "send later" and "undo send" options and includes
          improvements to search, email organization, and formatting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spotlight produces richer search results; with Live Text, it can
          return pictures that contain the queried text.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safari adds Shared Tab Groups and Passkeys, uses WebAuthn for
          password-less account management, gets a redesigned sidebar, and gains
          AVIF support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Messages now allows the user to edit and unsend recent iMessages,
          similar to iOS 16 and iPadOS 16.
        </li>
        <li>
          FaceTime gets Handoff, the ability to transfer a call between multiple
          Apple devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuity Camera, a feature that allows a user's iPhone to wirelessly
          serve as a front-facing camera, with support for Desk View on some
          iPhones.
        </li>
        <li>
          System Preferences is renamed to System Settings and gets a brand new
          tabbed interface and re-organized panes based on the iOS/iPadOS
          Settings app. Because of this, the app-specific "Preferences..." menu
          bar item has been renamed "Settings..." for all apps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photos app: iCloud Shared Photo Library allows multiple members of
          iCloud Family Sharing to add, edit, and delete photos in the same
          photo library.
        </li>
        <li>The Game Center dashboard is redesigned.</li>
        <li>Font Book gets a new visual design.</li>
        <li>Maps adds support for routes with multiple stops.</li>
        <li>
          Siri gets redesigned to match its appearance since iOS 14 and iPadOS
          14.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apple Music adds the ability for the user to mark artists as
          "favorites" and receive new music notifications from those artists.
        </li>
        <li>
          Print dialogs have been redesigned. Many users report that Print
          Presets no longer save all essential printer features (paper type,
          duplexing, color mode, print quality, etc.) requiring settings to be
          manually selected with every print job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to play ambient background sounds as an accessibility feature
          in System Settings.
        </li>
        <li>New backgrounds and screensavers.</li>
        <li>
          A bug was fixed in Disk Utility concerning the verification of Time
          Machine backup volumes.
        </li>
        <li>Improved game controller support.</li>
        <li>
          Apple's Virtualization framework: better support for multitouch
          gestures in macOS Ventura VMs, support for graphics acceleration,
          folder sharing, and Rosetta 2 in Linux VMs.
        </li>
        <li>Metal 3, with support for spatial and temporal image upscaling.</li>
        <li>Live Text now works in videos.</li>
        <li>
          About This Mac tab was updated. It now shows an image of the device
          you are using and shows less information, it also gives you an option
          to go to System Settings to see more info about your Mac.
        </li>
        <li><b>iCloud</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Advanced Data Protection: optional end-to-end encryption for all
            iCloud data except emails, calendars and contacts.
          </li>
          <li>Support for physical security keys</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Security</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rapid Security Response, a new update mechanism to rapidly patch
            security vulnerabilities without having to install a full system
            update; according to Apple, these patches will not require a reboot.
          </li>
          <li>
            New Login Items section in System Settings (in the General pane),
            which shows all programs that start on boot (including all
            LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons for both the user and the system). In
            previous versions of macOS, the Login Items list in the "Users &
            Groups" pane only showed programs that registered themselves to be
            displayed, and most malware would not have been listed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirmation before allowing data connections with USB-C
            accessories, to prevent malicious USB-C chargers from installing
            malware.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gatekeeper now checks the notarization of third-party apps every
            time they are launched.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lockdown Mode, which prevents USB devices from connecting when the
            Mac is asleep, blocks the installation of MDM profiles, limits the
            risk of malicious attachments in the Messages app, and removes
            just-in-time compilation for JavaScript in Safari.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built-in apps cannot be moved from the cryptographically verified
            Signed System Volume to another location where they could be
            tampered with.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Preview app on Mac no longer supports PostScript (.ps) and
          Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) files. Printing of such files, to a
          printer natively supporting PostScript, remains possible by accessing
          the Printer Queue from System Settings and dragging the file into the
          queue window.
        </li>
        <li>Network Utility has been removed.</li>
        <li>
          The Network Locations feature was removed from the graphical user
          interface. It can still be accessed from the command line.
        </li>
        <li>Help files related to dial-up modems have been removed.</li>
        <li>
          Schedule Shutdown, Restart and Boot have been removed from the
          graphical user interface. They can still be accessed from the command
          line.
        </li>
        <li>Support for USB 1.1 accessories is removed.</li>
