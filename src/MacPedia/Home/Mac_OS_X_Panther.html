      retail price of US$129 for a single user and US$199 for a five user,
      family license.

    <p>
      The main features of Panther included a refined Aqua theme, Exposé, Fast
      user switching, and a new Finder. Panther also included Safari as its
      default browser, as a change from Internet Explorer in Jaguar.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>Panther's system requirements are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PowerPC G3, G4, or G5 processor (at least 233 MHz)</li>
        <li>Built-in USB</li>
        <li>
          At least 128 MB of RAM (256 MB recommended, minimum of 96 MB supported
          unofficially)
        </li>
        <li>At least 1.5 GB of available hard disk space</li>
        <li>CD drive</li>
        <li>
          Internet access requires a compatible service provider; iDisk requires
          a .Mac account
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Video conferencing requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>333 MHz or faster PowerPC G3, G4, or G5 processor</li>
        <li>Broadband internet access (100 kbit/s or faster)</li>
        <li>Compatible FireWire DV camera or web camera</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because a New World ROM was required for Mac OS X Panther, certain older
        computers (such as beige Power Mac G3s and 'Wall Street' PowerBook G3s)
        were unable to run Panther by default. Third-party software (such as
        XPostFacto) can, however, override checks made during the install
        process; otherwise, installation or upgrades from Jaguar fails on these
        older machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Panther still fully supported the Classic environment for running older
        Mac OS 9 applications, but made Classic application windows
        double-buffered, interfering with some applications written to draw
        directly to screen.

      <summary class="level-one">New and changed features</summary>
      <span class="level-two">End-user features</span>
      <p>
        Apple advertised that Mac OS X Panther had over 150 new features,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Finder: Updated with a brushed-metal interface, a new live search
          engine, customizable Sidebar, secure deletion, colored labels
          (resurrected from classic Mac OS) in the filesystem and Zip support
          built in. The Finder icon was also changed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fast user switching: Allows a user to remain logged in while another
          user logs in, and quickly switch among several sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exposé: Helps the user manage windows by showing them all as
          thumbnails.
        </li>
        <li>
          TextEdit: TextEdit now is also compatible with Microsoft Word (.doc)
          documents.
        </li>
        <li>Xcode developer tools: Faster compile times with gcc 3.3.</li>
        <li>Preview: Increased speed of PDF rendering.</li>
        <li>QuickTime: Now supports the Pixlet high-definition video codec.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">New applications in Panther</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Font Book: A font manager which simplifies viewing character maps, and
          adding new fonts that can be used systemwide. The app also allows the
          user to organize fonts into collections.
        </li>
        <li>
          FileVault: On-the-fly encryption and decryption of a user's home
          folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          iChat AV: The new version of iChat. Now with built-in audio- and video
          conferencing.
        </li>
        <li>
          X11: Compatibility for applications based on the X Window System,
          commonly used for UNIX applications, is available through an optional
          install, found in the install disk. Mac OS X Panther is the first
          macOS version to officially support X11. It utilizes Quartz to provide
          hardware accelerated graphics and is based on the XFree86
          implementation of X Window System.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safari: A new web browser that was developed to replace Internet
          Explorer for Mac when the contract between Apple and Microsoft ended,
          although Internet Explorer for Mac was still available. Safari 1.0 was
          included in an update in Jaguar but was used as the default browser in
          Panther.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Other</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Microsoft Windows interoperability improvements, including
          out-of-the-box support for Active Directory and SecurID-based VPNs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built-in fax support, with Address Book integration.:  Sending a fax
          can be done using the native Print dialog. To receive faxes, users
          must pre-configure in System Preferences on how the system should
          handle an incoming fax, with options  including selecting a folder to
          save the incoming faxes, to automatically email to an address or to
          print via a selected printer, upon receiving of the fax.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secure Empty Trash, was a feature added in Mac OS X Panther to ensure
          files that are deleted cannot be recovered, through the use of data
          erasure techniques.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Additional</span>
      <p>
        Panther was Apple's earliest version of Mac OS X that supported WPA and
        WPA2 security for wireless networks (with the AirPort 4.2 software
        update).
