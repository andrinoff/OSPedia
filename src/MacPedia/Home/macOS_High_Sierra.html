      macOS High Sierra (version 10.13) is the fourteenth major release of
      macOS, Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers.
      macOS High Sierra was announced at the WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017 and was
      released on September 25, 2017. The name "High Sierra" refers to the High
      Sierra region in California. Its name signified its goal to be a
      refinement of the previous macOS version, macOS Sierra, focused on
      performance improvements and technical updates rather than features. This
      makes it similar to previous macOS releases Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion
      and El Capitan. Among the apps with notable changes are Photos and Safari.

      macOS High Sierra is the final version of macOS to support the Unibody
      iMac and the Polycarbonate Unibody MacBook, as its successor, macOS
      Mojave, drops support for the late 2009 and final models. The Unibody iMac
      was an all-in-one desktop manufactured by Apple while the Polycarbonate
      Unibody MacBook refers to one of the designs of MacBook models produced
      from 2006 to 2012.

      <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        All Macs that supported macOS Sierra support macOS High Sierra. They
        include the following models:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Late 2009 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Late 2009 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Late 2010 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2010 or later)</li>

        <li>Mac Pro (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        macOS High Sierra requires at least 2 GB of RAM and 20.12 GB of
        available disk space. It is also possible to install High Sierra on many
        older Macintosh computers that are no longer supported by Apple.
        However, it requires using a patch to modify the install image.

        <span class="level-three">Apple File System</span>
        <p>
          Apple File System (APFS) replaces HFS Plus as the default file system
          in macOS for the first time with High Sierra. It supports 64-bit inode
          numbers, is designed for flash memory, and is designed to speed up
          common tasks like duplicating a file and finding the size of a
          folder's contents. It also has built-in encryption, crash-safe
          protections, and simplified data backup on the go.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Metal 2</span>
        <p>
          Metal, Apple's low-level graphics API, has been updated to Metal 2. It
          includes virtual reality and machine-learning features, as well as
          support for external GPUs. The system's windowing system, Quartz
          Compositor, supports Metal 2.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Media</span>
        <p>
          macOS High Sierra adds support for High Efficiency Video Coding
          (HEVC), with hardware acceleration where available, as well as support
          for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF). Macs with the Intel Kaby
          Lake processor offer hardware support for Main 10 profile 10-bit
          hardware decoding, those with the Intel Skylake processor support Main
          profile 8-bit hardware decoding, and those with AMD Radeon 400 series
          graphics also support full HEVC decoding. However, whenever an Intel
          IGP is present, the frameworks will only direct requests to Intel IGP.
          In addition, audio codecs FLAC and Opus are also supported, but not in
          iTunes.
        </p>
        <p>
          HEVC hardware acceleration requires a Mac with a sixth-generation
          Intel processor or newer (late 2015 27-inch iMac, mid 2017 21.5-inch
          iMac, early 2016 MacBook, late 2016 MacBook Pro or iMac Pro).
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Other</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In High Sierra, kernel extensions ("kexts") require explicit
            approval by the user before being able to run.
          </li>
          <li>
            Certain UI elements, such as the Low Battery notification and App
            Store icon, were redesigned to either be based on the iOS 11
            equivalents or match with the overall less detailed design used in
            all releases since Yosemite.
          </li>
          <li>
            The time service <code>ntpd</code> was replaced with timed for the
            time synchronization.
          </li>
          <li>The FTP and telnet command line programs were removed.</li>
          <li>
            Caching Server, File Sharing Server, and Time Machine Server,
            features that were previously part of macOS Server, are now provided
            as part of the OS.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new “now playing” widget has been added to the Notification
            Center, based on the music Lock Screen toggle in iOS 11.
          </li>
          <li>
            The screen can now be locked using the shortcut Cmd+Ctrl+Q. The
            ability to lock screen using a menu bar shortcut activated in
            Keychain Access preferences has now been removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The 10.13.4 update added support for external graphics processors
            for Macs equipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports. The update discontinued
            support for external graphics processors in 2015 or older Macs,
            equipped with Thunderbolt 1 and 2 ports.
          </li>
          <li>
            Starting with 10.13.4, when a 32-bit app is opened, users get a
            one-time warning about its future incompatibility with the macOS
            operating system.

        <span class="level-three">Final Cut Pro 7</span>
        <p>
          Apple announced the original Final Cut Studio suite of programs will
          not work on High Sierra. Media professionals that depend on any of
          those programs were advised to create a double boot drive to their
          computer.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Photos</span>
        <p>
          macOS High Sierra gives Photos an updated sidebar and new editing
          tools. Photos synchronizes tagged People with iOS 11.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Mail</span>
        <p>
          Mail has improved Spotlight search with Top Hits. Mail also uses 35%
          less storage space due to optimizations, and Mail's compose window can
          now be used in split-screen mode.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Safari</span>
        <p>
          macOS High Sierra includes Safari 11. Safari 11 has a new "Intelligent
          Tracking Prevention" feature that uses machine learning to block third
          parties from tracking the user's actions. Safari can also block auto
          playing videos from playing. The "Reader Mode" can be set to
          always-on. Safari 11 also supports WebAssembly. The last version of
          Safari that High Sierra supports is 13.1.2. This version has known
          security issues.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
        <p>
          The Notes app includes the ability to add tables to notes, and notes
          can be pinned to the top of the list. The version number was
          incremented to 4.5.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Siri</span>
        <p>
          In High Sierra, Siri uses a more natural and expressive voice. It also
          uses machine learning to understand the user better. Siri synchronizes
          information across iOS and Mac devices so the Siri experience is the
          same regardless of the product being used.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Messages</span>
        <p>
          The release of macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 (and iOS 11.4) introduced
          support for Messages in iCloud. This feature allows messages to sync
          across all devices using the same iCloud account. When messages are
          deleted they are deleted on each device as well, and messages stored
          in the cloud do not take up local storage on the device anymore. In
          order to use the feature, the user has to enable two-factor
          authentication for their Apple ID.
        </p>
      </div>
      <span class="level-two">Problems</span>
      <p>
        macOS High Sierra 10.13.0 and 10.13.1 have a critical vulnerability that
        allowed an attacker to become a root user by entering "root" as a
        username, and not entering a password, when logging in. This was fixed
        in the Security Update 2017-001 for macOS High Sierra v10.13.1.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it was first launched, it was discovered that the WindowServer
        process had a memory leak, leading to much slower graphics performance
        and lagging animations, probably due to some last-minute changes in
        Metal 2. This was fixed in macOS 10.13.1.
      </p>
      <p>
        macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 had an error that caused DisplayLink to stop
        working for external monitors, allowing only one monitor to be extended.
        When using two external monitors, they could only be mirrored. Alban
        Rampon, the Senior Product Manager for DisplayLink, stated on December
        24, 2018, that the company was working with Apple to resolve the issue.
