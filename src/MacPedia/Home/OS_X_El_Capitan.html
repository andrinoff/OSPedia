      OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) is the twelfth major release of macOS
      (named OS X at the time of El Capitan's release), Apple Inc.'s desktop and
      server operating system for Macintosh. It focuses mainly on performance,
      stability, and security. Following the California location-based naming
      scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, El Capitan was named after the
      famous eponymous rock formation in Yosemite National Park. OS X El Capitan
      is the final version to be released under the name OS X. OS X El Capitan
      received far better reviews than Yosemite.

      The first beta of OS X El Capitan was released to developers shortly
      following the WWDC keynote on June 8, 2015. The first public beta was made
      available on July 9, 2015. There were multiple betas released after the
      keynote. OS X El Capitan was released to end users on September 30, 2015,
      as a free upgrade through the Mac App Store.
    </p>
    <p>
      OS X El Capitan is the final version of OS X to support aluminum Macs and
      Xserve, as its successor macOS Sierra is incompatible with the mid-2007
      and final models of these products.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        All Macs supporting OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks, and OS X
        Yosemite support OS X El Capitan, although not all of its features will
        work on older models. For example, Apple notes that the newly available
        Metal API is available on "all Macs since 2012".
      </p>
      <p>
        These computers can run OS X El Capitan, provided they have at least 2
        GB of RAM, with an exception of the last one:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Mid 2007 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Aluminum, Late 2008 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later)</li>
        <li>Xserve (Early 2009)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of these computers, the following models were equipped with 1 GB RAM as
        the standard option on the base model when they were shipped originally.
        They can only run OS X El Capitan if they have at least 2 GB of RAM.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Mid 2007 - Early 2008)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following computers support features such as Handoff, Instant
        Hotspot, AirDrop between Mac computers and iOS devices, as well as the
        new Metal API:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (Late 2013)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The upgrade varies in size depending upon which Apple Mac computer it is
        being installed on; in most scenarios, it will require about 6 GB of
        disk space.

      <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
      <p>
        OS X El Capitan includes features to improve the security, performance,
        design and usability of OS X. Compared to OS X Yosemite, Apple says that
        opening PDFs is four times faster, app switching and viewing messages in
        Mail is twice as fast and launching apps is 40% faster. The maximum
        amount of memory that could be allocated to the graphics processor has
        been increased from 1024 MB to 1536 MB on Macs with an Intel HD 4000
        GPU. OS X El Capitan supports Metal, Apple's graphics API introduced in
        iOS 8 to speed up performance in games and professional applications.
        Apple's typeface San Francisco replaces Helvetica Neue as the system
        typeface. OS X El Capitan also adopts LibreSSL in replacement of OpenSSL
        used in previous versions.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two">Window management</span>
      <p>
        OS X El Capitan introduces new window management features such as
        creating a full-screen split screen limited to two app windows side by
        side in full screen by pressing the green button on left upper corner of
        the window or <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> +
        <kbd>F</kbd> keyboard shortcut, then snapping any supported other window
        to that full screen application. This feature is slightly similar to,
        although less extensive than, the snap-assist feature in Windows 7 (and
        later) and several Linux desktop environments, such as GNOME. OS X El
        Capitan improves Mission Control to incorporate this feature across
        multiple spaces. It also enables users to spot the pointer more easily
        by enlarging it by shaking the mouse or swiping a finger back and forth
        on the trackpad.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Applications</summary>
        <div>
          <span class="level-three">Messages and Mail</span>
          <p>
            OS X El Capitan adds multi-touch gestures to applications like Mail
            and Messages that allow a user to delete or mark emails or
            conversations by swiping a finger on a multi-touch device, such as a
            trackpad. OS X also analyzes the contents of individual emails in
            Mail and uses the gathered information in other applications, such
            as Calendar. For example, an invitation in Mail can automatically be
            added as a Calendar event.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="level-three">Maps</span>
          <p>
            Apple Maps in El Capitan shows public transit information similar to
            Maps in iOS 9. This feature was limited to a handful of cities upon
            launch: Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico
            City, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Shanghai,
            Toronto and Washington D.C.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
          <p>
            The Notes application receives an overhaul, similar to Notes in iOS
            9. Both applications have more powerful text-processing
            capabilities, such as to-do lists (like in the Reminders
            application), inline webpage previews, photos and videos, digital
            sketches, map locations and other documents and media types. Notes
            replaces traditional IMAP-based syncing with iCloud, which offers
            better end-to-end encryption and faster syncing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="level-three">Safari</span>
          <p>
            Safari in El Capitan lets users pin tabs for frequently accessed
            websites to the tab bar, similar to Firefox and Google Chrome. Users
            are able to quickly identify and mute tabs that play audio without
            having to search for individual tabs. Safari supports AirPlay video
            streaming to an Apple TV without the need to broadcast the entire
            webpage. Safari extensions are now hosted and signed by Apple as
            part of the updated Apple Developer program and they received native
            support for content blocking, allowing developers to block website
            components (such as advertisements) without JavaScript injection.
            The app also allows the user to customize the font and background of
            the Reader mode.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="level-three">Spotlight</span>
          <p>
            Spotlight is improved with more contextual information such as the
            weather, stocks, news and sports scores. It is also able to process
            queries in natural language. For example, users can type "Show me
            pictures that I took in Yosemite National Park in July 2014" and
            Spotlight will use that request to bring up the corresponding info.
            The app can now be resized and moved across the screen.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="level-three">Photos</span>
          <p>
            Photos introduced editing extensions, which allow Photos to use
            editing tools from other apps.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">System Integrity Protection</summary>
        <p>
          OS X El Capitan has a new security feature called System Integrity
          Protection (SIP, sometimes referred to as "rootless") that protects
          certain system processes, files and folders from being modified or
          tampered with by other processes even when executed by the root user
          or by a user with root privileges (sudo). Apple says that the root
          user can be a significant risk factor to the system's security,
          especially on systems with a single user account on which that user is
          also the administrator. System Integrity Protection is enabled by
          default, but can be disabled.
