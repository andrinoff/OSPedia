      OS X Yosemite was announced and released to developers on June 2, 2014, at
      WWDC 2014 and released to public beta testers on July 24, 2014. Yosemite
      was released to consumers on October 16, 2014. Following the Northern
      California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks,
      Yosemite is named after the national park.

      <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        All Macintosh computers capable of running OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8.x)
        are able to run Yosemite as the two operating systems have the same
        requirements. However, to take full advantage of the Handoff feature,
        additional minimum system requirements include a Mac with Bluetooth LE
        (Bluetooth 4.0). As with Mavericks and Mountain Lion, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB
        of available storage, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 or later are
        required.
      </p>
      <p>These are the models that are compatible with OS X Yosemite:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Mid 2007 to Mid 2015)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Late 2008 to Mid 2010)</li>
        <li>12-inch MacBook (2015)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 to Early 2015)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 to Mid 2015)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009 to Late 2014)</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (Early 2008 to Late 2013)</li>
        <li>Xserve (Early 2009)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are the models that support new features such as Handoff, Instant
        Hotspot as well as AirDrop between Mac computers and iOS devices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)</li>

        <summary class="level-two">Design</summary>
        <p>
          Yosemite introduced a major overhaul of OS X's user interface,
          emphasizing flat graphic design over skeuomorphism, following the
          aesthetic introduced with iOS 7 and certain applications from OS X
          Mavericks. It is the first major redesign of the OS X user interface
          since 10.5 Leopard. Other changes include thinner fonts and blurred
          translucency effects. Some icons have been changed to correspond with
          those of iOS 7 and iOS 8. Yosemite maintains the OS X desktop
          metaphor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes,
          and the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the
          default system typeface. Yosemite is the only macOS version to use
          Helvetica Neue as the default typeface, as in El Capitan it was again
          changed, this time to Apple's own, newly-designed San Francisco
          typeface. In Yosemite, the Dock is a 2D translucent rectangular strip
          instead of a skeuomorphic glass shelf, reminiscent of the Dock design
          used in early versions of OS X through Tiger and in iOS since iOS 7.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Continuity</summary>
        <p>
          Many of Yosemite's new features focus on the theme of "continuity",
          increasing its integration with other Apple platforms and services
          such as iOS and iCloud. The Handoff functionality allows the operating
          system to integrate with iOS 8 devices over Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi;
          users can place and answer phone calls using their iPhone as a
          conduit, send and receive text messages, activate personal hotspots,
          or load items being worked on in a mobile app (such as Mail drafts or
          Numbers spreadsheets) directly into their desktop equivalent.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Notification Center</summary>
        <p>
          Notification Center features a new "Today" view, similar to that in
          iOS. The Today view can display information and updates from various
          sources, along with widgets. The widgets in the Today view are similar
          to those of iOS 8.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Photos</summary>
        <p>
          As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaces both iPhoto and Aperture. It uses
          iCloud Photo Library to upload all the user's photos across their
          devices.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Other</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spotlight is a more prominent part of the operating system; it now
            displays its search box in the center of the screen and can include
            results from online sources, including Bing, Maps, and Wikipedia.
            Stock applications such as Safari and Mail have been updated. In
            particular, many security features have been added to Safari, such
            as a custom history clearing option that lets users clear history,
            cookies, and other data from the previous hour, day, or two days. In
            addition, Apple added DuckDuckGo to its search offerings, a
            non-tracking search engine that doesn't store users' data. Safari
            allows you to remotely close tabs from an iOS device. Safari now
            supports browsing in private browsing mode with certain windows (as
            opposed to all the windows having to be either in or out of private
            browsing).
          </li>
          <li>
            The green "zoom" button on windows now has a different function in
            applications that support full-screen mode. Instead of simply
            enlarging the window, the button now enters full-screen mode,
            eliminating the full-screen button at the top-right corner of
            windows that has been present since Mac OS X Lion. However, holding
            the Option key (⌥) while clicking the zoom button or double-clicking
            on the window chrome continues to invoke the original behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is the new system-wide support for
            scripting with JavaScript, built upon JavaScriptCore and the Open
            Scripting Architecture. It features an Objective-C bridge which
            enables entire Cocoa applications to be programmed in JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Along with other framework changes, CloudKit was integrated in this
            release. CloudKit functions as a Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)
            and is one method for app developers to integrate access to Apple's
            iCloud servers into their apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a "dark mode" in System Preferences which makes the Dock
            and menu bar darker.
          </li>

        Other design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes,
        and the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the default
        system typeface. Yosemite is the only macOS version to use Helvetica
        Neue as the default typeface, as in El Capitan it was again changed,
        this time to Apple's own, newly-designed San Francisco typeface. In
        Yosemite, the Dock is a 2D translucent rectangular strip instead of a
        skeuomorphic glass shelf, reminiscent of the Dock design used in early
        versions of OS X through Tiger and in iOS since iOS 7.
