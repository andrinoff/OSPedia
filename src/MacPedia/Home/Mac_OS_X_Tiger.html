    <p>
      Mac OS X Tiger (version 10.4) is the 5th major release of macOS, Apple's
      desktop and server operating system for Mac computers. Tiger was released
      to the public on April 29, 2005, for US$129.95 as the successor to Mac OS
      X 10.3 Panther. Included features were a fast searching system called
      Spotlight, a new version of the Safari web browser, Dashboard, a new
      'Unified' theme, and improved support for 64-bit addressing on Power Mac
      G5s. Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger also had a number of additional features that
      Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with
      acceptable performance, such as fast file search and improved graphics
      processing.

      Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was included with all new Macs, and was also available
      as an upgrade for existing Mac OS X users, or users of supported pre-Mac
      OS X systems. The server edition, Mac OS X Server 10.4, was also available
      for some Macintosh product lines. Six weeks after the official release,
      Apple had delivered 2 million copies of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, representing
      16% of all Mac OS X users. Apple claimed that Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was the
      most successful Apple OS release in the company's history. On June 11,
      2007, at WWDC 2007, Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs, announced that more than 67%
      of the 22 million Mac OS X users were using Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apple announced a transition to Intel x86 processors during Mac OS X 10.4
      Tiger's lifetime, making it the first Apple operating system to work on
      Apple–Intel architecture machines. The original Apple TV, released in
      March 2007, shipped with a customized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger
      branded "Apple TV OS" that replaced the usual GUI with an updated version
      of Front Row.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was succeeded by Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard on October 26,
      2007, after 30 months, making Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger the longest-running
      version of Mac OS X. The last security update released for Mac OS X 10.4
      Tiger users was the 2009-005 update. The latest supported version of
      QuickTime is 7.6.4. The latest version of iTunes that can run on Mac OS X
      10.4 Tiger is 9.2.1. Safari 4.1.3 is the final version for Mac OS X 10.4
      Tiger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite not having received security updates since 2009, Mac OS X 10.4
      Tiger remains popular with Power Mac users and retrocomputing enthusiasts
      due to its wide software and hardware compatibility, as it is the last Mac
      OS X version to support the Classic Environment - a Mac OS 9 compatibility
      layer - and PowerPC G3 processors.

    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was initially available in a PowerPC edition, with
        an Intel edition released beginning at Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger. There is
        no universal version of the client operating system, although Mac OS X
        10.4 Tiger Server was made available on a universal DVD from version Mac
        OS X 10.4.7 Tiger. While Apple shipped the PowerPC edition bundled with
        PowerPC-based Macs and also sold it as a separate retail box, the only
        way to obtain the Intel version was to buy an Intel-based Mac bundled
        with it. However, it was possible to buy the 'restore' DVDs containing
        the Intel version through unofficial channels such as eBay, and
        officially through Apple if one could provide proof of purchase of the
        appropriate Intel Mac. These grey-colored 'restore' DVDs supplied with
        new Macs, are designed to only restore on the model of Mac that they are
        intended for. However, they can be modified to work on any Intel Mac.
        The retail PowerPC-only DVD can be used on any PowerPC-based Mac
        supported by Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.
      </p>

      <p>The system requirements of the PowerPC edition are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Macintosh computer with a PowerPC G3, G4 or G5 family processor</li>
        <li>Built-in FireWire</li>
        <li>DVD drive for installation</li>
        <li>256MB of RAM</li>
        <li>
          3GB of available hard disk space (4GB if the user installs the
          developer tools)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger removed support for older New World ROM Macs such as
        the original iMacs and iBooks that were supported in Mac OS X 10.3
        Panther; however it is possible to install Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger on these
        Macs using third-party software (such as XPostFacto) that overrides the
        checks made at the beginning of the installation process. Likewise,
        machines such as beige Power Mac G3s and 'Wall Street' PowerBook G3s
        that were dropped by Mac OS X Panther can also be made to run both Mac
        OS X Panther and Mac OS X Tiger in this way. Also, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger
        can be installed on unsupported New World ROM Macs by installing it on a
        supported Mac, then swapping hard drives. Old World ROM Macs require the
        use of XPostFacto to install Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mac OS X Tiger was the last version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC
        G3 family of processors.

            Apple advertised that Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger had over 150 new and
            improved features, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spotlight — Spotlight is a full-text and metadata search engine
              that can search everything on one's Mac, including Microsoft Word
              documents, iCal calendars and Address Book contact cards. The
              feature is also used to build the concept of 'smart folders' into
              the Finder. Spotlight will index files as they are saved, so they
              can be quickly and easily found through a search-as-you-type box
              in the menu bar. As a side-effect, it adds hidden folders and
              indexing files to removable media like USB flash drives.
            </li>
            <li>
              iChat AV — The new iChat AV 3.0 in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger supports up
              to four participants in a video conference and ten participants in
              an audio conference. It also now supports communication using the
              XMPP protocol. An XMPP server called iChat Server is included on
              Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger Server.
            </li>
            <li>
              Safari RSS — The new Safari 2.0 web browser in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger
              featured a built-in reader for RSS and Atom web syndication that
              can be accessed easily from an RSS button in the address bar of
              the web browser window. An updated version of Safari, included as
              part of the free Mac OS X 10.4.3 Tiger update, can also pass the
              Acid2 web standards test.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mail 2 — The new version of Mail.app email client included in Mac
              OS X 10.4 Tiger featured an updated interface, "Smart Mailboxes",
              which utilizes the Spotlight search system, parental controls, as
              well as several other features.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automator — A scripting tool to link applications together to form
              complex automated workflows (written in AppleScript, Cocoa, or
              both). Automator came with a complete library of actions for
              several applications that can be used together to make a Workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
              VoiceOver — screen reader interface similar to Jaws for Windows
              and other Windows screen readers that offers the blind and
              visually impaired user keyboard control and spoken English
              descriptions of what is happening on screen. VoiceOver enables
              users with visual impairment to use applications via keyboard
              commands. VoiceOver is capable of reading aloud the contents of
              files including web pages, mail messages and word processing
              files. Complete keyboard navigation lets the user control the
              computer with the keyboard rather than the mouse, a menu is
              displayed in a window showing all the available keyboard commands
              that can be used.
            </li>
            <li>
              A complete built-in Dictionary/Thesaurus based on the New Oxford
              American Dictionary, Second Edition, accessible through an
              application, Dictionary, a Dashboard widget, and as a system-wide
              command (see below).
            </li>
            <li>
              .Mac syncing — Though this was not a new feature, .Mac syncing in
              Tiger is much improved over Panther. Syncing tasks in Tiger are
              now accomplished through the .Mac system preferences pane rather
              than the iSync application.
            </li>
            <li>
              QuickTime 7 — A new version of Apple's multimedia software has
              support for the new H.264/AVC codec, which offers better quality
              and scalability than other video codecs. This new codec is used by
              iChat AV for clearer video conferencing. New classes within Cocoa
              provide full access to QuickTime for Cocoa application developers.
              The new QuickTime 7 player application bundled with Tiger now
              includes more advanced audio and video controls as well as a more
              detailed Information dialog, and the new player has been rebuilt
              using Apple's Cocoa API to take advantage of the new technologies
              more easily.
            </li>
            <li>
              New Unix features — New versions of cp, mv, and rsync that support
              files with resource forks. Command-line support for features such
              as the above-mentioned Spotlight is also included.
            </li>
            <li>
              Xcode 2.0 — Xcode 2.0, Apple's Cocoa development tool now includes
              visual modelling, an integrated Apple Reference Library and
              graphical remote debugging.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Dashboard — The Dashboard is a new mini-applications layer based
              on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which returns the desk accessories
              concept to Mac OS. These accessories are known as widgets. It
              comes with several widgets such as Weather, World Clock, Unit
              Converter, Dictionary/Thesaurus, and others (full list). More are
              available to download for free online. Its similarity to the
              Konfabulator application caused some criticism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automator — Automator uses workflows to process repetitive tasks
              automatically

            <li>
              Dictionary — A dictionary and thesaurus program that uses the New
              Oxford American Dictionary. It has a fast GUI for displaying the
              Dictionary, and allows the user to search the dictionary with
              Spotlight, to print definitions, and to copy and paste text into
              documents. Dictionary also provides a Dictionary service in the
              Application menu, and Cocoa and WebKit provide a global keyboard
              shortcut (ctrl-⌘-D by default) for all applications that display
              text with them. Its use was furthered in Mac OS X Leopard by
              providing definitions from Wikipedia. The Dictionary application
              is a more feature-filled version of the Dictionary widget.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quartz Composer — Quartz Composer is a development tool for
              processing and rendering graphical data.

          <summary class="level-two">Improvements</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An upgraded kernel with optimized kernel resource locking and
              access control lists, and with support for 64-bit userland address
              spaces on machines with 64-bit processors.
            </li>
            <li>
              An updated libSystem with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions;
              combined with the aforementioned kernel change, this allows
              individual applications to address more than 4 GB of memory when
              run on 64-bit processors, although an application using Apple
              libraries or frameworks other than libSystem would need to have
              two processes, one running the 64-bit code and one running the
              code that requires other libraries and frameworks.
            </li>
            <li>
              A new startup daemon called launchd that allows for faster
              booting.
            </li>
            <li>
              The printing dialog in Tiger now features a drop down menu for
              creating PDFs, sending PDFs to Mail, and other PDF related
              actions. However, the user interface was criticized for creating a
              hybrid UI element that looks like a plain button but acts like a
              pop-up menu. This is one of only three places in the entire Mac OS
              X interface where such an element appears.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dock menus now have menu items to open an application at login, or
              to remove the icon from the dock.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Window menu in the Finder now features a "Cycle Through
              Windows" menu item.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Get Info window for items in the Finder now includes a "More
              Info" section that includes Spotlight information tags such as
              Image Height &amp Width, when the file was last opened, and where
              the file originated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Early development of resolution independence. Apple notes that
              this will be a user-level feature in a future version of Mac OS X.
              Among the changes, the maximum size of icons was increased to
              256x256. However, the Finder does not yet support this size.

            <li>
              Core Image: A graphics processing API that allows programmers to
              leverage programmable GPUs for fast image processing for special
              effects and image correction tools. Some of the included Image
              Units are Blur, Color Blending, Generator Filters, Distortion
              Filters, Geometry Filters, and Halftone features.
            </li>
            <li>
              Core Data: A data persistence API that makes it easier for
              developers to handle structured data in their applications. Core
              Data provides undo, redo, and save functions for developers
              without them having to write any code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Core Video: A video graphics API that leverages Core Image to
              provide real-time video processing. Apple's Motion real-time video
              effects program takes advantage of Core Video in Tiger. Core Video
              lets developers easily integrate real-time video effects and
              processing into their applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Core Audio: Integrates a range of audio functionality directly
              into the operating system.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition to these APIs, Tiger introduces a new window theme,
            often described as 'Unified'. A variation on the standard,
            non-brushed metal theme used since the introduction of Mac OS X,
            this theme integrates the title bar and the toolbar of a window. A
            prominent example of an application that utilizes this theme is
            Mail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tiger is also the first version of Mac OS X to include the "Zoom"
            screen magnifier functionality.

            announced that the company would begin selling Mac computers with
            Intel x86 processors in 2006. To allow developers to begin producing
            software for these Intel-based Macs, Apple made available a
            prototype Intel-based Mac ("Developer Transition Kit") that included
            a version of Mac OS X v10.4.1 compiled to run on x86 processors.
          </p>
          <p>
            This build included Apple's Rosetta compatibility layer — a
            translation process that allows x86-based Macs to run software built
            only for PowerPC, with a moderate performance penalty. This is
            contrasted with the contemporary Mac OS 9 Classic mode, which used
            comparably larger amounts of system resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon after the Developer Transition Kits began shipping, copies of
            Tiger x86 were leaked onto file sharing networks. Although Apple had
            implemented a Trusted Computing digital rights management scheme in
            the transition hardware and OS in an attempt to stop people
            installing Tiger x86 on non-Apple PCs, the OSx86 project soon
            managed to remove this restriction. As Apple released each update
            with newer safeguards to prevent its use on non-Apple hardware,
            unofficially modified versions were released that circumvented
            Apple's safeguards. However, with the release of 10.4.5, 10.4.6, and
            10.4.7 the unofficially modified versions continued to use the
            kernel from 10.4.4 because later kernels have hardware locks and
            depend heavily on EFI. By late 2006, the 10.4.8 kernel had been
            cracked.
          </p>
          <p>
            At MacWorld San Francisco 2006, Jobs announced the immediate
            availability of Mac OS X v10.4.4, the first publicly available
            release of Tiger compiled for both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based
            machines. This version was the first version, other than the version
            provided with the Developer Transition Kits, to include Rosetta.
