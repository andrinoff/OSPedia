      Big Sur is the successor to macOS Catalina (macOS 10.15). The release of
      Big Sur was the first time the major version number of the operating
      system had been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000. After
      sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10 ("Mac OS X"), macOS Big Sur was
      presented as version 11 in 2020, and four subsequent versions incremented
      the major version number, similarly to previous versions of Apple's other
      OSes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) six years earlier,
      macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign. It features new blurs to
      establish a visual hierarchy, along with making icons more square and UI
      elements more consistent. Other changes include a revamp of the Time
      Machine backup mechanism, and the addition of the Control Center (which
      was previously introduced, exclusively for touch devices, with iOS 7). It
      is also the first macOS version to support Macs with ARM-based processors.
      To mark the transition, the operating system's major version number was
      incremented, for the first time since 2001, from 10 to 11. The operating
      system is named after the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast
      of California, continuing the naming trend of California locations that
      began with OS X Mavericks.
    </p>
    <p>
      macOS Big Sur is the final version of macOS that supports Macs with Nvidia
      graphics cards, specifically the 15-inch dual graphics late 2013 and mid
      2014 MacBook Pro models, as its successor, macOS Monterey, drops support
      for those models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing some indication as to how the pre-release operating system may
      have been viewed internally at Apple during its development cycle,
      documentation accompanying the initial beta release of macOS Big Sur
      referred to its version as "10.16", and when upgrading from prior versions
      of macOS using the Software Update mechanism to early beta releases, the
      version referred to was "10.16". An exception to this was the Developer
      Transition Kit, which always reported the system version as "11.0". macOS
      Big Sur started reporting the system version as "11.0" on all Macs as of
      the third beta release.
    </p>

    <p>
      To maintain backwards compatibility, macOS Big Sur identified itself as
      10.16 to legacy software and in the browser user agent.

      <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Unlike macOS Catalina, which supported every standard configuration Mac
        that Mojave supported, Big Sur drops support for various Macs released
        in 2012 and early 2013. Big Sur runs on the following Macs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Mid 2014 or later)</li>
        <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2013 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Late 2013 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)</li>
        <li>Developer Transition Kit (only up to Big Sur 11.3 beta 2)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using patcher tools (such as OpenCore Legacy), macOS 11 Big Sur can
        be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such
        as the 2012 iMac and the 2012 MacBook Pro. Using these methods, it is
        possible to install macOS Big Sur on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook
        Pro and iMac and 2009 Mac Mini running smooth with non-metal graphics.

        <span class="level-three">Support for Apple silicon</span>
        <p>
          macOS Big Sur is the first release of macOS for Macs powered by
          Apple-designed ARM64-based processors, a key part of the transition
          from Intel x86-64-based processors. The chip mentioned in demo videos,
          and used in the Developer Transition Kit, is the A12Z Bionic. On
          November 10, 2020, Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip,
          the Apple M1, in the Late 2020 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.
          Apple has said that it will support Intel Macs "for years to come",
          and most software that has not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use
          Rosetta 2, an update of a compatibility mechanism originally developed
          for the PowerPC-to-Intel x86 transition. Likewise, Apple also
          introduced an updated universal binary format, Universal 2, which
          allows developers to package their applications so that they can run
          natively on both ARM64 and x86-64 processors.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Support for iOS and iPadOS applications</span>
        <p>
          On Macs based on Apple silicon, macOS Big Sur can run iOS and iPadOS
          applications natively and without any modifications needed from
          developers, aside from allowing the app to be available on the Mac App
          Store. The first Macs with this capability are those that use the
          Apple M1 SoC (system on a chip).
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Time Machine overhaul</span>
        <p>
          Time Machine, the backup mechanism introduced back in Mac OS X 10.5
          Leopard, has been overhauled to utilize the APFS file system
          (introduced in MacOS High Sierra) instead of the outdated HFS+.
          Specifically, the new version of Time Machine makes use of APFS's
          snapshot technology. According to Apple, this enables "faster, more
          compact, and more reliable backups" than were possible previously with
          HFS+-formatted backup destinations. An independent evaluation of this
          claim found that Time Machine on macOS 11 in conjunction with APFS was
          2.75-fold faster upon initial local backup and 4-fold faster upon
          subsequent backups relative to macOS 10.15's Time Machine
          implementation using HFS+. A more modest yet nevertheless significant
          advantage was noted as well for backups to network-attached disks.
        </p>
        <p>
          New local (i.e. USB- or Thunderbolt-connected) and network-connected
          Time Machine backup destinations are formatted as APFS by default,
          though Time Machine can continue backing up to existing HFS+ backup
          volumes. There is no option to convert existing, HFS+-based backups to
          APFS; instead, users who want to benefit from the advantages of the
          new, APFS-based implementation of Time Machine need to start with a
          fresh volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the new version of Time Machine, encryption appears to be required
          (instead of merely optional) for local disks, but it remains elective
          for networked volumes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is no longer possible to restore the whole system using a Time
          Machine backup, as the signed system volume is not backed up. Non-core
          applications and user data can be restored in full using Migration
          Assistant, preceded by a system reinstall if necessary.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Spotlight</span>
        <p>
          Spotlight, the file system indexing-and-search mechanism introduced in
          Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, is faster and the interface has been refined.
          Spotlight is now the default search mechanism in Safari, Pages, and
          Keynote.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Signed system volume</span>
        <p>
          The system volume containing the core operating system is
          cryptographically signed. Apple indicates this is a security measure
          to prevent malicious tampering. This includes adding an SHA-256 hash
          for every file on the system volume, preventing changes from
          third-party entities and the end user.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Software updates</span>
        <p>
          Software updates can begin in the background before a restart, thus
          requiring less downtime to complete. Because system files are
          cryptographically signed, the update software can rely on them being
          in precise locations, thus permitting them to be effectively updated
          in place.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Encryption</span>
        <p>
          macOS Big Sur supports encryption at the file level. Earlier versions
          of macOS (10.15 Catalina and older) supported encryption only at the
          level of entire volumes. As of June 2020, this capability is known to
          be compatible with Macs based on Apple silicon; it is unclear whether
          it is compatible with Intel-based Macs.
        </p>

        <summary class="level-two">Application features</summary>
        <span class="level-three">Safari</span>
        <p>
          Big Sur includes Safari 14, which was also released for macOS Catalina
          and macOS Mojave on September 16, 2020. Safari 14 includes features
          such as a new home page in which users can customize what features are
          visible in addition to being able to set a custom wallpaper. It also
          allows the viewer to preview a page and favicon before visiting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safari 14 also includes built-in web page translations in English,
          Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese as well as
          support for 4K HDR content from Netflix on Macs with an Apple T2 chip,
          although none of these were made available for macOS Catalina and
          Mojave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy features such as iCloud Keychain (which notifies users of
          compromised passwords), extension privacy management and Privacy
          Report (which monitors privacy trackers and further increases Safari's
          security) were added for Safari 14. Users were now also able to import
          password from Google's Chrome browser in addition to being notified of
          compromised passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safari 14 also supports WebExtensions API, the WebP image format as
          well as VP9 decoding, the latter of which allows for the playback of
          4K and HDR content from YouTube. In addition, it allowed for better
          performance and power efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safari 14 ended support for Adobe Flash Player in September, three
          months prior to its end-of-life on December 31, 2020.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Messages</span>
        <p>
          The Messages app was rewritten to be based upon Apple's Catalyst
          technology to enable it to have feature parity with its iOS
          counterpart. The new version of the app included a refined design as
          well as the ability to pin up to nine conversations that can sync
          across iOS, iPadOS and macOS. Users were also now allowed to search
          for messages and share their names and photos. Photo thumbnails could
          now also be used for group chats on the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, users could mention contacts by putting the @ symbol in
          front of their name. They were also able to reply to specific
          messages. Memojis, 3d avatars were also made available on Messages. On
          Messages, users could now select photos based on parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, text message effects were added when users sent certain
          texts (e.g., texting "Happy Holi" will result in users seeing
          effects).
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Mac App Store</span>
        <p>Refinements and new features of the Mac App Store include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A new "nutrition label" section dedicated to the data and
            information an app collects, also featured in the iOS App Store
          </li>
          <li>A new extensions category for Safari</li>
          <li>
            Third party Notification Center widgets, similar to those also added
            in iOS and iPadOS 14.
